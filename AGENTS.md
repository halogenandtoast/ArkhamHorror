# AGENTS instructions for ArkhamHorror

This repository contains a Haskell backend (`backend/`) and a Vue/TypeScript frontend (`frontend/`).

## Agent Purpose

This file is intended to help AI agents and human collaborators understand the structure and conventions of the ArkhamHorror project. It provides detailed steps and examples to assist with generating and integrating new cards and scenarios.

## Formatting

* Haskell source must be formatted with **fourmolu** using the configuration at `backend/fourmolu.yaml`. Run `fourmolu -i <file>` before committing.
* TypeScript/Vue files should be formatted with **prettier** using the defaults configured by the project. Run `npx prettier -w <file>` if you modify frontend sources.

## Testing

* After modifying backend code, run `stack test` inside the `backend` directory.
* After modifying frontend code, run `npm run build` from `frontend` to ensure the project still compiles.

## 🌐 Internationalization (`Arkham.I18n`)

All translatable backend strings must use the `Arkham.I18n` module to generate internationalization (i18n) keys.

This module defines a declarative DSL using **implicit parameters** to manage translation *scopes* and *variables*. It ensures consistency, composability, and readability for any content that needs localization.

### 📌 Key Principles

- Use `withI18n` to initialize the context.
- Use `scope "something"` to define nested namespaces (`"game.card.Fight"`).
- Use variable helpers like `nameVar`, `countVar`, and `skillVar` to attach dynamic data.
- Generate keys with `ikey "SomeKey"`.

### 🧠 Implicit Context

| Parameter     | Type                  | Purpose                            |
|---------------|-----------------------|-------------------------------------|
| `?scope`      | `[Text]`              | Current scope stack                 |
| `?scopeVars`  | `Map Text Value`      | Key/value variable pairs for use in interpolation/debugging |

### 🛠️ Helper Functions

| Function         | Role |
|------------------|------|
| `withI18n`       | Initializes blank context |
| `scope` / `popScope` / `unscoped` | Manages nested namespace stack |
| `withVar` / `withVars` | Injects variables |
| `nameVar`, `countVar`, `skillVar`, `skillIconVar` | Common game-related variables |
| `ikey`           | Generates the final translation key |

### 🔍 Example

```haskell
withI18n $
  scope "game" $
  scope "card" $
  nameVar investigator $
  countVar 2 $
  ikey "Fight"
```

🔑 Produces key:  
```
"game.card.Fight name=s:\"Roland\" count=i:2"
```

### ✅ Guidelines
- Do **not** hardcode translation keys.
- Always use `Arkham.I18n` helpers in card definitions, scenario logic, and rule responses.
- This system is designed to support eventual integration with `.json`/`.po` translation files or frontend display.

## Adding new game content

* Haskell modules for cards, scenarios, and other game items live under `backend/arkham-api/library/Arkham`. Templates for creating these modules are defined in `backend/.projections.json`.
* Files representing game content should use CamelCase with no spaces in the name.
  * Card files follow these conventions using "Foo Bar" as an example:
    * Card with only a title -> `FooBar`
    * Card with a subtitle -> `FooBarSubtitle`
    * Duplicate name within the same set -> `FooBar_123` (where `123` is the card number)
    * Same name across different sets -> `FooBarSetName`
* Folder structure for common card types under `backend/arkham-api/library/Arkham`:
  * Acts -> `Act/Cards`
  * Agendas -> `Agenda/Cards`
  * Assets -> `Asset/Cards`
  * Enemies -> `Enemy/Cards`
  * Events -> `Event/Cards`
  * Locations -> `Location/Cards`
  * Scenarios -> `Scenario/Scenarios`
  * Skills -> `Skill/Cards`
  * Stories -> `Story/Cards`
  * Treacheries -> `Treachery/Cards`
  * Encounter-related helpers live in `EncounterCard` and `EncounterSet` modules.
* Each of these folders contains a `Cards.hs` file that indexes the available cards for that type.
* Revealed and unrevealed locations are managed in `backend/arkham-api/library/Arkham/Location/Cards.hs`.

## Card module conventions

## Card module conventions

The reference files above follow a very consistent layout. When adding new
cards or scenarios, keep these patterns in mind:

* Modules live under `Arkham/<Type>/Cards` (or `Arkham/Asset/Assets` for story
  assets). The module name matches the path, for example:

  ```haskell
  module Arkham.Location.Cards.EsotericOrderOfDagon
    (esotericOrderOfDagon, EsotericOrderOfDagon(..))
  where
  ```

* Import the card index for that type as `Cards` and the lifted import module
  for helpers:

  ```haskell
  import Arkham.Location.Cards qualified as Cards
  import Arkham.Location.Import.Lifted
  ```

* Define a `newtype` wrapping the appropriate attribute record and derive the
  standard classes (e.g. `IsLocation`, `HasModifiersFor`). Provide a builder
  function using helpers like `location`, `enemy`, `ally`, or `treachery`.

* Implement `HasAbilities` and `RunMessage` instances using the lifted message
  utilities shown in the examples.

* Register the new card in the relevant `Cards.hs` file so it can be looked up
  by card code.

* Scenario modules live in `Scenario/Scenarios` and usually have a companion
  `Helpers.hs` under `Scenarios/<ScenarioName>`. Campaign-wide utilities are
  placed in `Campaigns/<CampaignName>/Helpers.hs`.

## Step-by-step instructions for new cards

The general conventions above apply to all card modules. The following notes
give concrete steps for the most common types.

### Location card

1. Create `backend/arkham-api/library/Arkham/Location/Cards/<CardName>.hs` and
   match the module declaration.
2. Import `Arkham.Location.Cards` qualified as `Cards` and
   `Arkham.Location.Import.Lifted`.
3. Define `newtype <CardName> = <CardName> LocationAttrs` deriving the standard
   classes (`IsLocation`, `HasModifiersFor`, `Show`, `Eq`, `ToJSON`,
   `FromJSON`, `Entity`).
4. Provide a builder such as:

   ```haskell
   <cardName> :: LocationCard <CardName>
   <cardName> = location <CardName> Cards.<cardName> <shroud> <clues>
   -- or use `locationWith` / `locationWithUnrevealed` as needed
   ```

5. Implement abilities with `HasAbilities` using `extendRevealed attrs [...]`.
6. Handle messages in a `RunMessage` instance, delegating with
   `liftRunMessage` for unhandled cases.
7. Register the card in `Arkham/Location/Cards.hs` and add it to
   `allLocationCards`.

### Enemy card

1. Create `backend/arkham-api/library/Arkham/Enemy/Cards/<CardName>.hs`.
2. Import `Arkham.Enemy.Cards` as `Cards` and `Arkham.Enemy.Import.Lifted`.
3. Define `newtype <CardName> = <CardName> EnemyAttrs` and build the card with
   `enemy` or `enemyWith`.
4. Provide abilities with `HasAbilities` (`extend attrs [...]`).
5. Implement `RunMessage` in the usual pattern.
6. Register the card in `Arkham/Enemy/Cards.hs` and add it to the appropriate
   list (`allEncounterEnemyCards` or `allPlayerEnemyCards`).

### Story Asset

1. File `backend/arkham-api/library/Arkham/Asset/Assets/<CardName>.hs`.
2. Import `Arkham.Asset.Cards` as `Cards` and `Arkham.Asset.Import.Lifted`.
3. Define `newtype <CardName> = <CardName> AssetAttrs` and use builders like
   `ally` or `asset`.
4. Implement modifiers/abilities and a `RunMessage` instance if needed.
5. Register in the relevant set file under `Asset/Cards`, add the constant to
   `allEncounterAssetCards` (or the player list) and to `allAssets` in
   `Arkham/Asset.hs`.

### Agenda card

1. File `backend/arkham-api/library/Arkham/Agenda/Cards/<CardName>.hs`.
2. Import `Arkham.Agenda.Cards` as `Cards` and `Arkham.Agenda.Import.Lifted`.
3. Define `newtype <CardName> = <CardName> AgendaAttrs` deriving the agenda
   classes and build it with `agenda`.
4. Implement `RunMessage`, handling advancement when on side B.
5. Register the card in `Arkham/Agenda/Cards.hs` and add it to `allAgendas` in
   `Arkham/Agenda.hs`.

### Act card

1. File `backend/arkham-api/library/Arkham/Act/Cards/<CardName>.hs`.
2. Import `Arkham.Act.Cards` as `Cards` and `Arkham.Act.Import.Lifted`.
3. Define `newtype <CardName> = <CardName> ActAttrs` and build it with `act`.
4. Implement `RunMessage`, advancing when instructed.
5. Register the card in `Arkham/Act/Cards.hs` and add it to `allActs` in
   `Arkham/Act.hs`.

## Additional implementation guidelines

* Reuse existing helpers whenever possible. For encounter deck logic use
  `getEncounterDeckKey` along with the `DiscardUntilFirst` message.
* Use `scenarioI18n` when the scenario provides it to scope translation keys;
  otherwise wrap i18n helpers in `withI18n`.
* For horror healing prefer `getHealHorrorMessage` and check
  `canHaveHorrorHealed`.
* When effects may apply to other investigators use `affectsOthers`.
* Only invoke `beginSkillTest` for tests that are not bold. Attach abilities
  with `withBaseAbilities` or `withRevealedAbilities` as appropriate and avoid
  using "You" outside of `CardDef` or `Ability` definitions.
* `backend/.projections.json` includes templates for each card type showing the
  minimal module structure.

## Pull Request guidelines

* Keep commits focused and descriptive.
* In the PR summary list any commands run and indicate whether they succeeded.
* Do not commit build artefacts or files ignored by `.gitignore`.
