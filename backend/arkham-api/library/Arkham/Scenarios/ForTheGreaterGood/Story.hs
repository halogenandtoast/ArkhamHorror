      \ the Unvisited Isle. Tonight, we will finally bind the revenant and learn what\
      \ it knows. We must not allow the secrets of AZATHOTH to be lost to those who\
      \ would do humanity harm.”"

      \ the Lodge before you are discovered. The conspiracy you have unveiled leaves\
      \ you with even more questions. If the revenant Mr. Sanford speaks of is what you\
      \ think it is, binding it will surely protect Arkham, as he claims. But what\
