    [ "After what you saw at the Unvisited Isle, your faith in humanity is on thin\
      \ ice. You feel like a wayward spirit, wandering the streets with no destination\
      \ in mind. You wish you could just return home and forget everything that has\
      \ happened in the last few weeks, but you know that is just a pipe dream. After\
      \ hours of aimless meandering, you snap back to reality when you realize you have\
      \ wandered into Independence Square. A soft breeze carries a trail of brittle\
      \ leaves across the grass of the clearing, drawing your eyes upward. There,\
      \ sitting amidst a circle of autumn-colored leaves, sits Anna Kaslow. Her eyes\
      \ are closed in a deep trance, her fingers pressed against the temples of her\
      \ head. Laid out on the grass in front of her is a wool blanket, and on top of\
      \ that, a circle of overlapping facedown tarot cards. You approach and take a\
      \ seat in front of the fortune teller. It’s only now that you realize just how\
      \ sore and tired you are. Every one of your muscles aches with pain, and it takes\
      \ a significant amount of effort for you to not immediately pass out."

    [ "You recognize the soothsayer from your investigation into the disappearances at\
      \ Josef Meiger’s manor. It was her advice that led the second set of victims to\
      \ their doom, or so you suspect. Oddly enough, she appears to recognize you, as\
      \ well. She runs her fingers along the circle of cards before her. “I suspect the\
      \ past few weeks have been quite arduous for you. Are you here for guidance?” You\
      \ grimace. The last time Anna read somebody’s fortune, it did not end well for\
      \ them. What makes you think you will be any different?"

    [ "Anna opens her eyes. “I was wondering when we would meet again.” You wonder\
      \ aloud how she could possibly not know, when everything else she has predicted\
      \ has come to pass. Your remark earns you a hearty chuckle from the soothsayer.\
      \ “That doesn’t mean I know everything, my dear.” She runs her fingers across the\
      \ circle of cards. “I suspect the past few weeks have been quite arduous for you.\
      \ Are you here for more guidance?” You grimace. This all began with a reading of\
      \ your fortune. What makes you think another reading will make this all go away?"

    [ "Before you can answer, Anna turns over the card closest to her. It depicts a\
      \ furtive hooded figure with five swords embedded in the ground around it. Others\
      \ cower and flee before the victorious figure, and a maelstrom of dark clouds\
      \ brew over its head. Above this image, the card reads: FIVE OF SWORDS. “You may\
      \ feel as though you have been defeated, but you must not give in to despair. The\
      \ battle may be over, but your struggle has not yet ended.” Misery catches in\
      \ your throat. You want nothing more than for this nightmare to be over, but\
      \ Anna’s words ring true: you know it will not end unless you put an end to it\
      \ yourself."
    , "A flash of light burns across the sky, followed swiftly by a resounding crack\
      \ of thunder. The clouds above are not natural. Phantasmal shapes shift and churn\
      \ within the mist above. If you listen closely, you can faintly hear their howls\
      \ of pain and sadness drifting on the wind. “It has begun,” Anna utters quietly.\
      \ You rise to your feet, ignoring your exhaustion, your pain, and your fear."

    [ "The spirit cackles as she hears your words, but her laughter is soon cut short.\
      \ Emerging from the trees, the remainder of Anette’s coven–led by the red-haired\
      \ witch Erynn–surround Anette wordlessly. Erynn gives you a solemn nod, her\
      \ conviction showing through her stern demeanor. Understanding why they have\
      \ come, you step aside and allow them to do their work."
    , "One of the witches draws a circle in the dirt around Anette, while the rest\
      \ bind her with tendrils of searing energy. The revenant shrieks and wails in\
      \ agony, but the witches dare not cease. Finally, as their chants rise to a\
      \ crescendo, Erynn pierces the sanctity of the circle with her knife, pressing\
      \ firmly against the air and straining as though she were attempting to pierce\
      \ solid stone. Keziah’s ghost departs in a whirl of spectral mist, dissipating\
      \ into thin air with a final cry. Anette’s body, unsupported, collapses to the\
      \ ground. “It’s over,” you say, placing a hand on Erynn’s shoulder."
    , "“No,” she replies harshly, gesturing to the sky above. The storm clouds have\
      \ all disappeared, yet you count not a single star in the night sky. The borders\
      \ of the horizon frame the empty void above you, a breach so enormous you had not\
      \ even realized it was there. How long had it loomed over the city while you\
      \ spent your time warding against lesser incursions?"
    , "You ask what can be done to close a breach of such size. She clenches her jaw.\
      \ “I don’t know. But I know who does.” She kneels over Anette, raises her hand,\
      \ and slaps her hard across the face. Anette jerks awake, startled out of her\
      \ catatonic state."
    , "“Is this what you wanted, sister?” Erynn drags her to her feet, forcing her to\
      \ look up at the catastrophe she has wrought."
    , "“You know it isn’t,” Anette replies, her voice ragged. “I only wanted us all to\
      \ have some semblance of the strength she possessed. I had no desire to use it in\
      \ the same way she did. But the spirit took control, and I could not resist.” She\
      \ lowers her head in resignation. “I’m sorry, sisters. I failed us all. I was not\
      \ strong enough.”"

    [ "You wouldn’t put it past the president of the Silver Twilight Lodge to lie\
      \ about the consequences of your actions – after all, he has already deceived you\
      \ more than once before. You ask him what he means when he says you will all be\
      \ extinct. He grimaces and tells you to look outside."

    , "Sanford limps after you, peering up at the night sky. You ask what can be done\
      \ to close a breach of such size, but before he can respond, coils of darkness\
      \ emerge from the shadows, twisting into dark cloaks. In seconds you are\
      \ surrounded by the witches of Anette’s coven. The high priestess steps forward,\
      \ glaring at Carl Sanford with all of the intensity of hell itself."
    , "“Do not trust the word of this sinister worm,” she warns you. “Everything he\
      \ has done, he has done to further his own agenda. He would gladly hold the world\
      \ hostage if it meant one last chance at power.”"
    , "Despite his wounds, Sanford rises to his feet and bellows back at her: “What\
      \ hypocrisy! Do you forget that it was you and your misguided sect who started\
      \ all of this? Summoning the dead, asking them for power?” He scoffs. “We would\
      \ have elevated all of humanity. You sought only to elevate yourselves.” Sanford\
      \ turns to appeal to your judgment one last time. “Do not be a fool,” he says\
      \ quietly. “This outcome is not what the Lodge desires. Allow me to help, and\
      \ together maybe we can return things to normal.”"

      \ boundless power. Above, hundreds of phantasmal shapes reach out, a web of power\
      \ linking the witches and their deceased brethren. The wraiths descend, each\
      \ claiming a body for themselves, manipulating it to their own ends. The witches’\
      \ only show of resistance is the blood that drips from their eyes as their\
      \ unwilling spell reaches its culmination."
    , "“It is time!” The disembodied voice of Keziah declares through Anette’s lips.\
      \ “The Primal Chaos awaits! Hear us, Daemon Sultan!” Her voice rises into the\
      \ night, and a breach greater than the sky itself opens. The borders of the\
      \ horizon frame the empty void above. It reaches into infinity, beyond the\
      \ confines of three-dimensional space. “I have done as you commanded of me,” she\
      \ says to a being who is not present, but can hear her every word. “Now reap this\
      \ world of the living, and let them suffer for their mistakes.” With that, the\
      \ spectral figures vanish one by one, whisked away by the emptiness above. Anette\
      \ and her sisters collapse to the ground unceremoniously. A thin, discordant\
      \ flute warbles throughout the fabric of the world..."

      \ receive the power promised to them and claim their rightful place in the new\
      \ world that they will create. The tome Sanford reads from glows with\
      \ witch-light. “The bonds of mortality have held us back for too long!” He\
