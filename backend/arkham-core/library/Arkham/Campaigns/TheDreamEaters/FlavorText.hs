    , "Something odd was happening in Arkham, Massachusetts."
    , "Typically, this would not be a surprise to the residents of the dreary New\
      \ England town. Indeed, Arkham has always been well-known for its strange—some\
      \ would say supernatural—occurrences. The nature of this particular circumstance,\
      \ however, was anything but typical."
    , "It all began in the latest issue of Tales from Nevermore. A writer by the name\
      \ of Virgil Gray described a journey he had taken in his dreams—a journey he\
      \ claimed was not a work of fiction on his part. He wrote of a long, spiraling\
      \ staircase, an unbearably hot pillar of sentient fire, a tree that came from the\
      \ moon, and a curious talking cat...among other things equally difficult to\
      \ believe. But it wasn’t this extraordinary tale that first drew your attention.\
      \ Soon after Virgil’s tale was published, Tales from Nevermore began to receive\
      \ and publish letter after letter from those who had read Virgil’s story and\
      \ claimed to have experienced the same exact dream. Before long, the Arkham\
      \ Advertiser picked up the story, and news of this strange phenomenon reached the\
      \ ears of experts."
    , "Virgil Gray was convinced to undergo therapy at the local asylum, and many more\
      \ who shared in the writer’s psychosis were committed as well. The prevailing\
      \ theory among academics is that Virgil’s dream felt so real that he could not\
      \ separate fact from fiction, and his writings spread his delusions to others\
      \ like a form of shared hysteria. You remain unconvinced. After all, there is\
      \ much that is not known about the simple act of dreaming. Medical experts have\
      \ wildly differing theories on the state of one’s brain during sleep. Recently,\
      \ experts like Sigmund Freud have proposed that dreams are manifestations of\
      \ one’s subconscious desires, fears, or obsessions. Fortune tellers, for their\
      \ part, have long believed that dreams can be sifted and interpreted in order to\
      \ tell the dreamer’s past or future. But if these theories are true, how could\
      \ multiple parties—all from very different walks of life—have the same shared\
      \ experiences in their dreams? What if our modern understanding of sleep is all\
      \ wrong? What if there really is a place our consciousness travels to when we\
      \ sleep—a land of dreams that exists beyond our waking world?"
    , "You and your companions have gathered together to get to the bottom of this\
      \ strange phenomenon. If others in town can travel to another world in their\
      \ dreams, perhaps you can, too. You’ve re-created the circumstances of Virgil’s\
      \ journey perfectly. If all goes well, half of you will take the trip to this\
      \ “dreamland” and back. The rest will stay in the waking world, studying your\
      \ companions’ sleep patterns to ensure nothing goes wrong..."

    [ "As you travel out of the Enchanted Woods, you pass through rolling green\
      \ meadows under a bright-blue, cloudless sky. You speak with the blond-haired\
      \ man—who introduces himself as Randolph Carter— for several hours along your\
      \ journey south. You pass through a town Randolph calls Nir and over a stone\
      \ bridge spanning a wide river. Since the man seems friendly and\
      \ knowledgeable about both your world and this one, you explain to him your\
      \ situation: that you had followed the writings of a man named Virgil Gray to\
      \ reach this strange land, in order to see for yourself the truth of his\
      \ story. “There is a place in Ulthar where you may yet meet this man for\
      \ yourself,” Randolph responds. “When we reach Ulthar, I will show you.”"
    , "The town of Ulthar is not quite what you had imagined. The border of the\
      \ town is marked by a cobblestone road separating its quaint cottages from\
      \ the rolling green meadows beyond. Inside the town, narrow cobbled streets\
      \ are filled almost to capacity with cats of all kinds and colors, which part\
      \ as you approach. Old peaked roofs and overhanging upper stories arch over\
      \ the hilly streets; the entire village seems a haphazard cluster of homes\
      \ and old-fashioned businesses. As you reach the town square near the center\
      \ of the village, Randolph stops and addresses you with a youthful smile.\
      \ “Welcome to Ulthar,” he proclaims. “As I mentioned before, you are quite\
      \ safe here. There is but one paramount law to keep in mind as you traverse\
      \ this place: in the town of Ulthar, no one may kill a cat.” Given how\
      \ utterly packed the streets are with cats, you wonder aloud if this is\
      \ indeed a town run by cats. “Not quite,” Randolph replies, pondering your\
      \ words, “though I suppose one might call it the center of cat society here\
      \ in the Dreamlands. The reason for that law’s existence is a story for\
      \ another time. First, come—I have a feeling we’ll find this ‘Virgil’ fellow\
      \ you speak of at Einar’s.”"
    , "Randolph leads you through the town square, which is surrounded by\
      \ buildings adorned with cat motifs in the form of statues, signs, and even\
      \ stained-glass windows. You eventually arrive at one such building bearing a\
      \ sign that reads “Einar’s Place.” Inside is a medieval-style tavern filled\
      \ with long wooden tables. You spot several patrons and three times as many\
      \ cats. One such patron at the wooden counter feeds one of the cats small\
      \ strips of dried meat. He is a handsome man in his early thirties, with\
      \ short dark hair, a strong jaw, and sharp cheekbones. You recognize him\
      \ instantly as the writer Virgil Gray. In the back of your mind, you wonder\
      \ if this chance meeting is merely an act of fortune or something\
      \ preordained, for good or for ill."
    , "Regardless, you approach the man and introduce yourself, along with\
      \ Randolph. Virgil shakes your hand and Randolph’s with a joyful smile. “Well\
      \ met, fellow dreamers!” the writer says, a hint of boyish excitement in his\
      \ voice. “It is wonderful to meet more fellow believers. I had become so sick\
      \ and tired of reading about my supposed ‘illness’ in the papers.”"
    , "You nod your head in agreement and inform Virgil that you intend to find\
      \ some proof of this discovery to bring back to the waking world. “Don’t you\
      \ think I tried that?” he replies, stymied. “Sadly, it is impossible for one\
      \ who is asleep to bring anything from this realm into the real world. This\
      \ is all imagination, you see. Ideas, concepts, fantasies. You cannot hold a\
      \ thought in your hands, can you?”"
    , "Randolph interjects. “There is a place within the Dreamlands that may\
      \ hold the proof you seek. I have seen it in my dreams. I visited there three\
      \ times, each time just a fleeting moment before I was snatched away by the\
      \ rising sun...but try as I might, I cannot find the way again. I have spent\
      \ many nights searching.”"
    , "“Oh?” Virgil asks, intrigued. “And what is this place?”"
    , "“It is a marvelous city,” he describes, his eyes aglow with wonder,\
      \ “golden and lovely like nothing I have seen before or since. A city beyond\
      \ the peaks of the unknown mountain Kadath, where no one has ever set foot\
      \ before. There, veiled within the clouds and crowned by stars, lies the onyx\
      \ castle of the Great Ones.”"
    , "Virgil idly pets the cat on the countertop next to him as he is absorbed\
      \ by Randolph’s tale. It is a slender creature with lustrous black fur, dark\
      \ as the void of space itself. “Then we must find this place! Even if it does\
      \ not have the proof we seek, it sounds like the adventure of a lifetime.\
      \ Enough to fill a hundred pages, or more!”"
    , "You tell Virgil and Randolph that before you commit to such an\
      \ adventure, you must return to the waking world and tell your companions\
      \ about your experiences. Just then, another voice, cryptic and quiet,\
      \ chimes: “Oh, you can’t wake up. The eye is upon you now.”"
    , "You and the others spin your heads around, searching for the source of\
      \ the voice. The barkeeper? Another patron? Then Virgil’s black cat stretches\
      \ and sits up, its piercing yellow eyes reflecting the light of the sun\
      \ through the window outside. “I have waited a long time for you to seek\
      \ Kadath,” it says."
    , "“You can talk?” Virgil says, nearly toppling over his stool as he jumps in surprise."
    , "“I’m a cat, you dolt. Of course I can talk,” the black cat replies,\
      \ licking its paw out of boredom. “You have met a thousand cats from Ulthar,\
      \ and now you are surprised?”"
    , "“But...I thought...” Virgil wipes his brow with his palm."
    , "“Never mind him,” the black cat says, addressing you directly. “I assure\
      \ you, you cannot cross back into the waking world until you find Kadath. It\
      \ is your only way out. In the meantime, I will return and tell your\
      \ companions about the quest ahead of you.” It hops off of the countertop and\
      \ walks confidently toward the exit. “Though I imagine their task will be\
      \ even more arduous...”"

      \ hospital. “Oh, pick your jaws up off the ground and listen.” The cat rises\
      \ and leaps onto the top of a nearby fence, walking along it with the kind of\
