    , "Something odd was happening in Arkham, Massachusetts."
    , "Typically, this would not be a surprise to the residents of the dreary New\
      \ England town. Indeed, Arkham has always been well-known for its strange—some\
      \ would say supernatural—occurrences. The nature of this particular circumstance,\
      \ however, was anything but typical."
    , "It all began in the latest issue of Tales from Nevermore. A writer by the name\
      \ of Virgil Gray described a journey he had taken in his dreams—a journey he\
      \ claimed was not a work of fiction on his part. He wrote of a long, spiraling\
      \ staircase, an unbearably hot pillar of sentient fire, a tree that came from the\
      \ moon, and a curious talking cat...among other things equally difficult to\
      \ believe. But it wasn’t this extraordinary tale that first drew your attention.\
      \ Soon after Virgil’s tale was published, Tales from Nevermore began to receive\
      \ and publish letter after letter from those who had read Virgil’s story and\
      \ claimed to have experienced the same exact dream. Before long, the Arkham\
      \ Advertiser picked up the story, and news of this strange phenomenon reached the\
      \ ears of experts."
    , "Virgil Gray was convinced to undergo therapy at the local asylum, and many more\
      \ who shared in the writer’s psychosis were committed as well. The prevailing\
      \ theory among academics is that Virgil’s dream felt so real that he could not\
      \ separate fact from fiction, and his writings spread his delusions to others\
      \ like a form of shared hysteria. You remain unconvinced. After all, there is\
      \ much that is not known about the simple act of dreaming. Medical experts have\
      \ wildly differing theories on the state of one’s brain during sleep. Recently,\
      \ experts like Sigmund Freud have proposed that dreams are manifestations of\
      \ one’s subconscious desires, fears, or obsessions. Fortune tellers, for their\
      \ part, have long believed that dreams can be sifted and interpreted in order to\
      \ tell the dreamer’s past or future. But if these theories are true, how could\
      \ multiple parties—all from very different walks of life—have the same shared\
      \ experiences in their dreams? What if our modern understanding of sleep is all\
      \ wrong? What if there really is a place our consciousness travels to when we\
      \ sleep—a land of dreams that exists beyond our waking world?"
    , "You and your companions have gathered together to get to the bottom of this\
      \ strange phenomenon. If others in town can travel to another world in their\
      \ dreams, perhaps you can, too. You’ve re-created the circumstances of Virgil’s\
      \ journey perfectly. If all goes well, half of you will take the trip to this\
      \ “dreamland” and back. The rest will stay in the waking world, studying your\
      \ companions’ sleep patterns to ensure nothing goes wrong..."
