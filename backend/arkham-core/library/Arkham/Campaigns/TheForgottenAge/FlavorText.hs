    \ University and an old friend of mine. He’d said he had a job offer for\
    \ me, but frankly, I didn’t know what to expect."
  , "Harlan introduced me to an associate of his: Alejandro Vela, a\
    \ distinguished historian from across the southern border. Mr. Vela is\
    \ a graduate of a prestigious university in Mexico City, and has spent\
    \ many years researching the Aztec Empire. He claims that he has found\
    \ evidence regarding the existence of an unheard-of Aztec city-state called\
    \ Eztli. His strange and unprecedented findings were not accepted by the\
    \ university, and he’s become a pariah among his peers."
  , "Alejandro came to Arkham to seek funding for an expedition into the\
    \ rainforests of southern Mexico, where he believes that the ruins of the\
    \ Eztli altepetl lie undiscovered. His description of this city-state’s origins\
    \ defies modern understanding of Mesoamerican history. Despite this—\
    \ or, knowing my old friend, because of this—Harlan is enthralled by\
    \ Alejandro’s discoveries. Miskatonic University has agreed to fund the\
    \ expedition (albeit meagerly), and Harlan wants me to go along."
  , "The way I see it, there’s a good chance we’re looking for something that\
    \ doesn’t even exist. But if there’s even a slight chance these Eztli people\
    \ existed, the historical significance would be profound. We debated\
    \ the issue for some time, but in the end, we accepted Alejandro’s offer.\
    \ Preparations are underway, and we should be setting off by the end of\
    \ the month. With any luck, we’ll have this journal filled with all manner\
    \ of interesting discoveries. If not, perhaps it’ll be a nice wedge to place\
    \ beneath Harlan’s lopsided desk."
