  [ "Act I came and went without a hitch, as it often did in\
    \ rehearsal. You couldn’t help but note the blank, dismissive expressions\
    \ on many of the audience members’ faces, and you wonder how the\
    \ audience will react to the play’s disturbing second half. The role of\
    \ Cassilda is tiresomely boring for the first half of the play, although\
    \ you enjoy portraying her regal charm. You find yourself missing your\
    \ previous co-star, Miriam Twain, and suddenly the dread and regret you\
    \ had felt in Paris comes flooding back. With a sigh, you retreat to a dark\
    \ corner backstage to escape the sounds of stagehands preparing for the\
    \ next scene. You try to quell your emotions and replace your thoughts\
    \ with those of Cassilda’s—her hopes, her fears, her fate."
  , "Just then, you catch the Stranger staring at you from afar, and you find\
    \ yourself shaking at the mere sight of him. Even though they continue\
    \ to replace the actor who plays the Stranger before each show (and\
    \ indeed many times during rehearsals), you know that this last-minute\
    \ replacement is the most horrid of them all. Realizing you never caught\
    \ his name, a shiver of terror courses through your spine. Have you found\
    \ your way back to the wolves, like a lost lamb? You cannot look away—\
    \ his gaze is inescapable. Everything goes black."

  [ "You turn over the folded program in your hand, reading it for what seems\
    \ like the hundredth time. “Miskatonic Playhouse presents: The King in\
    \ Yellow,” it reads. “A special one-night engagement at Arkham’s very\
    \ own Ward Theatre. An irresistible drama in two acts. Production staged\
    \ and directed by Nigel Engram.” The cast is a small ensemble, with one\
    \ unattributed credit at the end: “The Stranger.”"
  , "To have such a highly anticipated play come to Arkham all the way\
    \ from Paris is a noteworthy event, even if it is just for one night. For\
    \ weeks leading up to the show, it was the talk of the town. It seemed\
    \ so unassuming…and yet, you have evidence something sinister is at\
    \ work. It started with the disappearance of one of the stagehands at the\
    \ theatre—a boy of only seventeen who missed rehearsal one night and\
    \ was never seen again. Then, less than two weeks before the performance,\
    \ there was the musician whose corpse was found with a gun in its mouth.\
    \ Perhaps most chilling was the crazed man the coppers had picked up\
    \ in Independence Square who had been ranting and raving about the\
    \ “King’s return.” He was brought to Arkham Asylum, and you were\
    \ surprised to discover that he was not alone in his delusions."
  , "Finding these events suspicious, you and your companions have delved\
    \ deeper into the matter. Although no connection can be proven, these\
    \ weren’t the only strange events surrounding the up-and-coming play.\
    \ Instances of suicide and madness have followed in its wake, and you are\
    \ determined to discover why."
  , "The lights in the auditorium dim, and a spotlight shines on the\
    \ stage. What unfolds is not quite what you expected. Slow-paced\
    \ and monotonous, the first act of The King in Yellow is a tedious\
    \ bore. The setting and characters are compelling, but the meandering\
    \ and nonsensical story does little to entertain or inform. You begin\
    \ to wonder whether the dreadful events surrounding The King in\
    \ Yellow aren’t connected, after all. Perhaps it was just your overactive\
    \ imagination; how could such a trivial and unassuming show cause such\
    \ pandemonium? You are surprised when the first act closes without any\
    \ rising action or revelation. The lights rise for the intermission, and you\
    \ consider leaving early, stifling a yawn. Before you are able to decide,\
    \ however, you find yourself drifting…drifting…to sleep."

    \ What if it was all a trick of your mind? What if the hauntings that\
    \ follow The King in Yellow are but transitory? The answers to all of\
    \ your questions might lie inside. Cautiously, you open the front door\

    \ pork wafts through the air. As you suspected, the signs of struggle and\
    \ oddities you noticed before have vanished without explanation. Then, as\
    \ you turn the corner into the dining room, you find the Stranger speaking\
    \ with another man—tall, mustached, wearing a fine black suit, and\
    \ holding a silver-handled cane. The Stranger turns to you, his gaze drills\
    \ through your mind, and your vision swims with agony. Before you realize\
    \ it, you are running as fast as you can, toppling through the front doorway\
    \ in a haze of pain and disorientation. Without time to catch your breath,\
    \ you race to your vehicle and speed away, hands trembling upon the\

    \ to realize he’s no longer institutionalized, which for some reason makes\
    \ him even more terrified. “He’s coming for me, he’s coming for me!” he\
    \ rambles, sometimes for hours at a time. Finally, during an unusually\
    \ warm and starry night, Daniel is calm enough to open up to you. “The\
    \ King in Yellow, it’s not just a play,” he explains. “It’s a being named\
    \ Hastur, and He’s already claimed me. But there’s still time for you. You\
    \ are not yet possessed. You have yet to speak the Oath. Whatever you\
    \ do, speak not his name. Do not give in.” You ask him about the strange\
    \ events that have been happening across town, and of the cultists and\
    \ creatures you’ve encountered. “They are trying to find Carcosa,” he\
    \ says matter-of-factly. You recognize the name as the fictional city from\
