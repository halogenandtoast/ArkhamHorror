  [ "Rays of hot yellow sunlight beat down on you from above as your car speeds down\
    \ the dusty highways of southern Texas, just outside of San Antonio. It has been\
    \ several days since you hit the road from Arkham on your way to Mexico City,\
    \ where you may be able to get answers from some of Alejandro’s associates—or\
    \ even better, from his adversaries in academia. Your recent investigations in\
    \ Arkham uncovered much, but despite all the knowledge you laid bare, the trail\
    \ went cold soon after. The “Brotherhood” that you exposed in Arkham has all but\
    \ vanished from the city. Its members left behind little information as to their\
    \ next objective, other than the name “The Nexus of N’kai,” a place of power that\
    \ Ichtaca believes is the Brotherhood’s ultimate destination. Enigmatic as ever,\
    \ the Eztli warrior sits in the passenger seat next to you. She is tense and\
    \ coiled like a spring, the Ford’s leather seat offering her little comfort."

  [ "“How close are we?” Ichtaca asks for the hundredth time since departing from\
    \ Arkham. “We have to get to Anahuac as fast as we can. The longer we take, the\
    \ more time the Brotherhood has to reach the Nexus.” You recognize the old Aztec\
    \ name for the Valley of Mexico, and inform Ichtaca that you will be crossing the\
    \ border into Mexico within the hour. She crosses her arms and grits her teeth."

  [ "Ichtaca is quiet and pensive for the majority of your journey. Your questions\

    \ you are being left in the dark."

  [ "Throughout the journey south, the device you recovered from the clutches of the\
    \ Brotherhood continues its endless humming, wrapped in a thin bedsheet on the\
    \ back seat of your car. Your understanding of the relic’s nature is deepening."

  (Just "Growing Concern")
  [ "The loss of the Eztli relic weighs heavily on your mind. Clearly, its value is\
    \ more than simply academic. It holds a power within it that you cannot yet begin\
    \ to fathom. You are certain that the shadowy Brotherhood is behind its\
    \ disappearance, but for what purpose?"

  (Just "Alejandro's Throughts")
  [ "Throughout your journey, Alejandro scribbles endlessly in his journal, the\
    \ sound of pencil scratching against paper a constant reminder of his presence.\
    \ He remains huddled in the back seat of the car, his knees keeping the journal\
    \ still, his brows furrowed in thought. “This ‘Brotherhood’ is the least of our\
    \ concerns,” he says with an air of finality. “I’ve been trying to decrypt the\
    \ glyphs the device bears. The symbols are clearly not Aztec, nor Mayan, nor are\
    \ they from any other Mesoamerican civilization, for that matter. I believe there\
    \ is some other place the relic belongs. Somewhere it was taken from. Wouldn’t\
    \ you agree, Miss Ichtaca?”"
  , "Ichtaca’s already-grim expression grows darker, her eyes narrowing. She doesn’t\
    \ bother to turn around in her seat before addressing Alejandro. “It belongs\
    \ somewhere meddlesome scholars cannot abuse its power,” she replies in a cold\
    \ tone, and that is the end of the discussion."
  , "Crossing the border into Mexico is a less stressful endeavor than you imagined\
    \ it to be, due to Alejandro’s connections. You are waved through customs with\
    \ nary a stray glance, and soon enough, you are on your way to Mexico City."

  (Just "Out of Gas")
  [ "Fuel is a constant concern throughout your journey south. You are able to\
    \ refuel several times along the way at general and hardware stores, but\
    \ eventually your car putters out along the side of the road, just north of the\
    \ southern border. You and Ichtaca are forced to walk several miles to the\
    \ nearest town to refuel, setting you back several hours."

  [ "After arriving in Mexico City, you are disheartened to find very little\
    \ information regarding the Brotherhood or the Nexus. You peruse the archives of\
    \ the city’s libraries and universities, but come up empty- handed. You can’t\
    \ find any of Alejandro’s former colleagues in the city, and even his enemies\
    \ refuse to speak to you, save for one: a woman named Padma Amrita, who studied\
    \ Alejandro’s work before he came to Arkham. She agrees to meet you at a trendy\
    \ lounge in the southern part of the city, late at night. Ichtaca remains a short\
    \ distance away, observing your new informant silently."
  , "Padma knows a lot about Alejandro’s research, and even claims to have heard of\
    \ the Nexus of N’kai, though she refuses to tell you how to find it. “It is a\
    \ fool’s errand,” she tells you. “There is nothing to find. Just a myth. Trust\
    \ me, many have searched for it. None have found it.” You point out that the\
    \ Eztli people were not a myth, and she responds with a charming smile. “Perhaps\
    \ not, but all this about the Eztli still being alive? Undiscovered for\
    \ centuries?” She laughs heartily. “Bushwa, pure and simple. Come now, you don’t\
    \ expect real scholars to believe that, do you?” Your eyes are drawn to Ichtaca,\
    \ who is overhearing the conversation with crossed arms, her nails dug into her\
    \ forearms. Padma’s eyes wander over as well, the hint of a smirk on her lips.\
    \ “In any event, I apologize, but I don’t have any information for you. Only a\
    \ sap would continue this ‘research’ any further. Good day.” Padma leaves with\
    \ another alluring smile, a sweet scent trailing behind her as she departs."
  , "Once she is out of sight, Ichtaca sits down next to you, and you discuss your\
    \ next move. After a week of failure after failure, she has grown impatient. You\
    \ offer a few more suggestions regarding whom you could speak to next, but her\
    \ mind is elsewhere. When you return to your hotel, she immediately retreats to\
    \ her room to make preparations for tomorrow. You decide to settle in for the\
    \ night, and before long, your mind is meandering hazily into a dreamless\
    \ slumber. In the far recesses of your awareness, however, you can hear Ichtaca\
    \ reciting a cryptic incantation..."

  [ "When you next open your eyes, you are back in the bed of your hotel room. You\
    \ raise your hand to shield your eyes from the sunlight that pierces through the\
    \ bedroom’s curtains. The glaring light is akin to a vice crushing your temples.\
    \ Thin wisps of incense smoke fill the air."
  , "Rising to your feet requires a colossal effort. A small voice in the back of\
    \ your mind tells you it was all a figment of your imagination, a nightmare\
    \ fueled by weariness. It is the voice of self-preservation warning you to avoid\
    \ the path of lunacy you have set upon. You ignore it and rise to your feet, your\
    \ legs trembling with terror and exhaustion. Quietly, you call out for Ichtaca,\
    \ wondering if she remembers what happened last night—or if she was even there to\
    \ begin with. You find her slumped on the floor, her back against the door of the\
    \ hotel room. She is unconscious and unresponsive, her face ashen. After several\
    \ worrisome minutes attempting to wake her, you finally succeed. She sputters\
    \ into consciousness, coughing violently and convulsing as though possessed. “The\
    \ cave. The maw in the sky, bathed in red. Did you see it?”"
  , "Your head pulses with pain as you attempt to remember the events of last night,\
    \ and you shake your head. “It must be the path that leads to the Nexus,” she\
    \ continues, gripping her head tightly with one hand. You attempt to help her to\
    \ her feet, but she pushes you away. “What was I thinking? The boundary is\
    \ thinning. Any tension and it could have snapped.” Her gaze shifts toward you.\
    \ “I should not have involved you in this. But, like it or not, you are involved.\
    \ It is too late to go back. I know where to find the Nexus, and you must journey\
    \ with me.”"

  [ "You are assailed by a prismatic assortment of colors and lights as your mind\
    \ hurtles back into place. When you next open your eyes, you are lying in the\
    \ city’s central plaza, your head still spinning from the sensation of\
    \ plummeting. A small voice in the back of your mind tells you it was all a\
    \ figment of your imagination, a daydream. It is the voice of self-preservation\
    \ warning you to avoid the path of lunacy you have set upon. You ignore it and\
    \ rise to your feet, your legs trembling with terror and exhaustion."
  , "“That woman...She must have realized who I am and followed through the breach I\
    \ made. Perhaps she wished to know the location of the Nexus, as well,” Ichtaca\
    \ says cryptically. Your head pulses with pain as you attempt to remember the\
    \ events of the past few hours. “You saw it, did you not? The cave. The maw in\
    \ the sky, bathed in red,” she continues, searching the sky in contemplation. “It\
    \ must be the path that leads to the Nexus.”"
  , "It is difficult for you to recall with precision what happened on the other\
    \ side, but the image of the red cavern flickers across your memory. You confirm\
    \ with Ichtaca that you saw the cavern as well, and ask her how she knows it\
    \ leads to the Nexus. Her bloodshot gaze meets yours, and you think you spot the\
    \ hint of a smirk tugging on her lips. “It is a difficult thing...Peering across\
    \ the boundary, into the very threads of time. Perhaps you are more than you\
    \ seem,” she responds, the irony of her statement lost on her. Though she departs\
    \ without answering your question, you understand the answer that remains\
    \ unspoken: In the haze of broken timelines and unexplainable phenomena, the path\
    \ you saw was “one future.” A future you intend to fulfill."

  (Just "Resolution 2")
  [ "The boundary along the horizon shimmers as your path home closes before your\
    \ eyes. The surreal haze and the weightlessness you have experienced throughout\
    \ this vision fades, and you are left with the sudden understanding that this is\
    \ not a dream. You are trapped in a time that is not your own, and Ichtaca is\
    \ nowhere to be found."
  , "You wander for what seems like hours. Days. Weeks. Your mind cannot take any\
    \ more. The realization that you may be trapped here forever is terrifying.\
    \ Desperation and despair take hold of your mind, a bout of madness and\
    \ loneliness that you cannot escape.You no longer remember how long it has been\
    \ since you arrived here. You have not slept or eaten."
  , "Suddenly, after an eternity of waiting, the boundary cracks, and the sky is\
    \ flooded with a blinding white light. When you next open your eyes, you are\
    \ lying in the city’s central plaza, your head still spinning from the sensation\
    \ of plummeting. Ichtaca helps you to your feet, your legs trembling with terror\
    \ and exhaustion. You ask her how long you were out, and she shakes her head. “It\
    \ doesn’t matter. You’re here now.” You ignore her evasive answer, but resentment\
    \ boils to the surface. Did she leave you behind on purpose, or by accident? “You\
    \ saw it, did you not?” she asks. “The cave. The maw in the sky, bathed in red.”\
    \ You stare blankly, your memory suddenly hazy. “It matters not,” she continues.\
    \ “I know now where to find the Nexus, and you must journey with me.”"
