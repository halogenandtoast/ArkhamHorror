  [ "Several hours after you wake, your laborious descent pays dividends. The red\
    \ glow emanating from the bottom of the steps grows brighter with each step. The\
    \ stone floor finally levels off, and the choking tunnel walls open to reveal a\
    \ labyrinthine network of immense, far-reaching caverns. Littered throughout the\
    \ caverns are the ruins of a vast city, the likes of which you have never seen.\
    \ The elaborate stone architecture has been worn away by ages of abandonment, but\
    \ you sense that there is a history here that runs deeper than you can even\
    \ fathom. When you turn around to question Ichtaca, you notice a faint yellow\
    \ glow in her eyes, her pupils narrowed and contracted. “Yoth...the last refuge\
    \ of Valusia...” she quietly intones."
  , "Just then, a terrifying roar echoes throughout the cavern. The walls and floor\
    \ shake with tremendous force, and the red glow that permeates the area\
    \ brightens. A flood of hisses emerges from the tunnels all around you. Ichtaca\
    \ walks to the edge of a nearby precipice and looks out over the vast depths. “He\
    \ is here. I feel his presence. The Father of the Serpents..._Yig_.”"

  [ "You realize now that Ichtaca has her own agenda. Alejandro, as well—both have\
    \ been using you for their own ends, keeping you from the truth. You raise a\
    \ weapon and demand answers from her, catching her by surprise. “Yig demands the\
    \ relic be brought to the Nexus,” she responds anxiously. Her eyes glow brightly,\
    \ and her skin starts to scale over. Your eyes narrow, and you move to corner her\
    \ against the edge of the precipice, so she cannot escape. “The relic cannot be\
    \ trusted to the hands of Brotherhood: this much is true...For it is Valusia that\
    \ shall be restored to glory. Yig has called, and I must answer.” Before you can\
    \ react, she throws herself off the edge and into the depths below."

  ["You approach Ichtaca and rest a hand on her shoulder. Your companion takes a\
    \ deep breath and turns to face you. Her eyes are cast downward in shame, and\
    \ they have returned to their normal color. “I...I’m sorry. I have brought you to\
    \ your ruin. He called out to me, long ago, told me of my heritage, of my people.\
    \ I did his bidding willingly.” She clenches her fists, her gaze meeting yours.\
    \ “But now I realize I was wrong. Humanity deserves its time on Earth. You may\
    \ have inherited it from far more powerful forces, but it is humanity’s time, not\
    \ theirs.” You don’t completely understand what she is saying, but you understand\
    \ the implication. Whatever Ichtaca truly is, she is on your side. A calm silence\
    \ lingers between you, an unspoken bond that joins you as one. “We must get to\
    \ the Nexus and prevent the serpents from recovering the relic,” she explains\
    \ after a few moments, breaking the silence. You nod in agreement."

  [ "You hesitate, unsure what to do next. What are Ichtaca’s true motives? Why has\
    \ she led you here? Before you have the chance to react, she draws her bow and\
    \ aims an arrow at your heart. “Thank you for aiding me this far,” Ichtaca says\
    \ curtly, “but the time has come for us to part ways. Yig has called, and I must\
    \ answer.” Her yellow eyes narrow and shine brightly."

  [ "“You must leave this place at once. This is not humanity’s battle. It is ours.\
    \ We cannot let you or the Brotherhood foil our plans. Not now, not when we are\
    \ so close.” Her hand wavers for a moment, and her eyes flicker again. You can\
    \ tell that something is tearing at her, weighing on her mind. Finally, she\
    \ speaks again. “Go now. Before I change my mind. And if you wish to live, do not\
    \ follow. I will not give you a second chance.” Ichtaca swiftly departs, eyes\
    \ trained on you until she leaves your sight. Despite her warning, you feel that\
    \ you have no choice but to follow. If you don’t, who will protect humanity?"

  [ "“Now drop your weapons.” The betrayal stings your chest, and you are gripped\
    \ with anger and despair. Thoughts of escape flash across your mind, but you have\
    \ seen her skill with a bow—with her steady aim, you would be dead before you\
    \ took two steps. You have no choice but to comply. Your weapons clatter to the\
    \ ground, one at a time. “Good. Now the relic: hand it to me.” Grimacing, you\
    \ take a few steps forward and offer the relic to Ichtaca."

  [ "As Ichtaca reaches out to grab the relic, you pull out your concealed\
    \ pocketknife and quickly attack, catching her by surprise. The blade cuts deeply\
    \ across her forearm. Blood sprays across your chest, and she staggers with pain,\
    \ gripping her arm. Her heel clips a rock near the edge of the precipice, and she\
    \ tumbles over the side of the ledge, her scream growing distant as she falls.\
    \ You barely have time to recover from the shock of what just happened, as\
    \ another colossal roar fills the cavern, and the ground shakes. You gather your\
    \ belongings and continue your descent."

    \ hard and scaly. You take a few steps back, knuckles white with anger. “Go now.\
    \ Before I change my mind,” she says. “And if you wish to live, do not follow.  I\
    \ will not give you a second chance.” Ichtaca swiftly departs, eyes trained on\

  [ "After hours and hours of travel, you’ve only just scratched the surface of this\
    \ boundless subterranean world. Humanity could spend centuries mapping out these\
    \ tunnels and never complete the task. No matter how quickly you plumb the\
    \ depths, the serpents chasing you are hot on your tail. You are intruders in\
    \ their home, and they know these hellish tunnels better than you. With your\
    \ wounds slowing you down and panic seeping into every one of your decisions,\
    \ your death at the hands of these creatures is inevitable. Despair worms its way\
    \ into your mind. When the serpents inevitably catch up to you, you are crossing\
    \ one of the cavern’s many long bridges of stone that span a wide, dark chasm.\
    \ Serpent creatures on both sides of the chasm flank you, spear tips corralling\
    \ you against the precarious edge of the bridge. A small hunk of stone cracks at\
    \ your heel and detaches, falling into the inky void below. You do not hear it\
    \ strike the floor of the chasm. There is no hope to escape or flee this time—you\
    \ have no choice but to accept your fate. The spear tips press you closer to the\
    \ edge. You close your eyes and fall."
