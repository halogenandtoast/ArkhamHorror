    \ The floor is covered in a plush carpet, and several comfortable sofas and small\
    \ round tables fill the warmly lit room. Portraits of world-weary Lodge members\
    \ line the walls around you. Carl Sanford, president of the Lodge, sits across\
    \ from you, idly swirling a glass of Merlot in his wrinkled hand."
  , "“The Silver Twilight Lodge pursues knowledge that can help us elevate our\
    \ understanding of the universe,” Mr. Sanford explains, pausing to take a sip\
    \ from his wine. “The creature you encountered in Josef Meiger’s estate—its\
    \ appearance is not the only peculiar happening in Arkham as of late. Tell me:\
    \ have you experienced anything else recently that might be connected to these\
    \ events?”"

  [ "You tell Mr. Sanford about your experience last week—waking up in the middle of\
    \ the woods, the strange mist that weaved throughout the trees, the witches and\
    \ their spell. He leans forward and listens intently as you explain the night’s\
    \ strange events, your memories still somewhat of a haze. You conclude your\
    \ story, and the elderly man considers your words. “Interesting,” he says at\
    \ last. “I know of this coven. They are led by a witch named Anette Mason. Their\
    \ magic is no trivial thing. They have passed down arcane secrets that can\
    \ manipulate the energies of the universe. It is dangerous knowledge they\
    \ possess—knowledge I believe they derived from a powerful witch who fled from\
    \ Salem over two hundred years ago. Does the name ‘Keziah’ mean anything to you?”"
  , "You nod. Everyone in Arkham has at least some passing knowledge of the witch\
     \ whose ghost supposedly haunts the old condemned “Witch House” in French Hill.\
     \ Most believe her to be a work of fiction; a tall tale meant to scare young\
     \ children away from the decrepit house. Mr. Sanford’s steely gaze and humorless\
     \ tone makes it clear to you that this is not the case. “Perhaps this Anette is a\
     \ true descendant of Keziah, or perhaps she is simply using her name. In any\
     \ event, I believe these events are connected. To that end, I have a task for\
     \ you, on behalf of the Silver Twilight Lodge.” Carl Sanford rises to his feet,\
     \ using his cane more for show than for balance. You rise as well, ready to\
     \ perform whatever duties are necessary to get to the bottom of this mystery."
  , "“We need as much information about this coven as we can obtain. If there is any\
    \ place that will have these answers, it is the house where Keziah herself lived\
    \ all those years ago.” You nod in agreement—there are too many questions you\
    \ need answered. What spell were the witches casting that night in the woods?\
    \ What is their motive? And what is their connection to the creature that\
    \ kidnapped those four unfortunate souls? You shake Mr. Sanford’s hand and depart\
    \ for the Witch House."

    \ strange inscriptions and arcane glyphs. “I believe the creature you encountered\
