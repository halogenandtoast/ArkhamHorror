  [ "The night passes with Ichtaca resting in your living room. You get no sleep for\
    \ the remainder of the night, your thoughts drifting between concern and\
    \ disbelief. Her story is preposterous, but you feel compelled to believe it\
    \ nonetheless. You’ve known that the relic from the Eztli ruins had some deeper\
    \ purpose ever since you first laid eyes on it. When you emerge from your bedroom\
    \ the next morning, your uninvited guest is sitting at your dining-room table,\
    \ arms crossed tightly across her chest. Her piercing eyes trace your every move\
    \ like a bird watching its prey. No pleasantries are exchanged. “Where is the\
    \ relic now?” Ichtaca asks impatiently. “Where have you brought it?” You explain\
    \ that it is safe, in good hands. She shakes her head, her knuckles white with\
    \ frustration. “I assure you it is not.”"

    \ the Miskatonic University Museum. Despite the early hour, Dr. Horowitz should\
    \ be at her office preparing for the long day ahead of her. The operator connects\
    \ you after a short delay. Elli gives you an unusually curt greeting, her voice\
    \ cracking and unsteady. As soon as you ask about the relic, she scoffs. “Not\
    \ you, too! Mr. Walsted is practically knocking down my office door, and two\
    \ reporters have been harrassing me all morning!”"
  , "You ask her what the trouble is, and she lets out a long sigh. “The relic is\
    \ missing,” she explains. “None of the security guards knows what happened. One\
    \ minute it was in its display case; the next it was gone. And before you ask,\
    \ no, Mr. Vela is nowhere to be found.” Suddenly she is yelling to another party,\
    \ “One moment please! I am on the telephone!” She apologizes to you tersely and\
    \ hangs up a moment later."
  , "Sure enough, Alejandro is not answering his telephone, and none of his other\
    \ associates have seen him since yesterday. “Believe me now?” Ichtaca asks,\
    \ rising to her feet and gathering her things. “We’ve wasted enough time. Find\
    \ the relic and meet me back here tonight. Don’t follow me.”"

    \ always known him to be an early riser. The operator connects you after a short\
    \ delay. Harlan’s voice is shaky and rough.  He cuts you off as soon as you ask\
    \ about the relic. “Don’t!” he barks. “They’re listening. They know I am keeping\
    \ it here. They have already taken Alejandro.” You try to calm him down so you\
    \ can ask him what he means, but he cuts the conversation short. “I have to go.\
    \ They are here!—” The line goes dead."

    \ answering your questions, but surprisingly, she relents. According to Ichtaca,\
    \ her people have spent ages protecting the relic from interlopers who would use\
    \ it for nefarious purposes. She speaks cryptically, in half-riddles and tall\
    \ tales, although she refuses to explain where her people come from and how they\
    \ have remained hidden for so long.  When pressed about the relic, all she says\
    \ is that it controls the flow of time, and that it must not be tampered with."
  , "“It must return to its rightful place,” she explains. Her gaze is relentless,\
    \ unwavering. “Do you understand? It cannot fall into the wrong hands. If you\
    \ help me recover it, I will aid you in return. Just promise me you will not use\
    \ it.”"

    \ paranoid?..."
