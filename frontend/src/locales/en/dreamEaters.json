Even in places where the Dreamlands borders the waking world, one cannot simply walk between them.

It is only natural the key to these kinds of dreams should be lost with age.”</p><p>“What foolishness!” the black cat scolds. “It is not ‘maturity’ to leave one’s imagination behind. You have abandoned the best part of you. You are more a mewling kitten now than any child I have ever met.”</p><p>“Perhaps you are right,” Randolph agrees, downcast. “I forced myself to believe that earthly concerns were more important than juvenile fantasies of gilded spires, perfumed jungles, and twilight realms...and now I fear I shall never see such wonders again.” He turns back toward you, his eyes full of regret. “And worse, I will be unable to guide you.”</p>"

He thinks for a brief time, mulling over the possibilities. Then, his eyes go wide as he realizes something important. “There was an incident many years ago. It was the last time I was involved with something supernatural—that is, before today,” he explains. “I met a friend of mine—Joel Manton— in the graveyard next to the old abandoned house in the Merchant District. The one they call the Unnamable. I didn’t want to believe that it was truly haunted, as the stories told, but in merely repeating the legend, I drew the creature’s ire.”<p><p>You ask of the creature, and Randolph closes his eyes as a violent shudder courses up his spine. “It cannot be described. All I know is that we barely survived. It was my fault Joel was hurt. From that day forth, I have had no desire to delve into the supernatural or the superstitious. Not because I did not believe, but because I was frightened. Is that why the key eludes me? Is that why I can no longer dream?” The realization hits him, clear as day. “I know where we have to go. That is where I lost the key. That must be where it can be regained!” he exclaims, wide-eyed.</p><p>As Randolph frantically tries to hail a taxicab, you realize where he means to go: to the house without a name, where the indescribable creature that still haunts his memory resides...</p>"

It is an inhospitable place. Many of the creatures we have seen crossing over into our world come from this region.

It seems the Corsairs who hunted you down and captured you were only agents—or perhaps slaves—of a much greater evil: a race of greyish-white toad-like creatures with no eyes and slippery skin concealed beneath a loose disguise of silken clothing. You notice the creatures tend to stay below deck, and none of them deign to interact with you at all. Despite their disguises, the mere sight of one makes you retch. If they are indeed the masters of the Corsairs, this cannot bode well for you. You are kept apart from Virgil, and suspect he is on a different ship entirely.</p><p>More days pass. You have no way of telling how long it’s been since your capture. You have been kept well fed—that is, if being forced to eat bitter porridge from a dirty clay bowl counts as “well fed.” What concerns you most is the ship itself. Though you are sure it’s still moving, you no longer feel it rock back and forth as the waves push it from side to side, nor do you hear the sounds of the ocean or of gulls cawing over the coast. In fact, you hear very little at all now: only the occasional commands of one of the beasts from below deck, and the shouting of Corsairs in reply. No churning sea. No wind in the sails. Nothing at all.</p><p>Panic seizes your mind. What if you are destined for some strange port from which there can be no return? Could they have have sailed off the face of the planet itself? You have to do something. Escape, somehow. You try desperately to come up with a plan of action, but in vain. Corsairs relentlessly patrol the brig, and even if you managed to slip your bonds and sneak past them, where would you go?</p><p>Just as you begin to lose hope, a familiar face descends from the top deck. It is the ship captain you hired in Dylath-Leen: a chubby, middle- aged fellow with a bushy beard and long hair pulled into a bun atop his head. He peeks around, realizes he is alone with you, and runs to your side. “I am so sorry, my friends,” he stammers quietly. “I had no idea who I was dealing with. I was tricked, I swear. I did not know that they were...I did not know...” he trails off, red-faced with guilt. You aren’t entirely sure what he means, but obviously he had something to do with your capture. Regardless, he is your only chance at escape. You tell him all will be forgiven if he helps you. He ponders for a moment, looks around, then finally nods and slices through your bonds with a curved knife.</p><p>Freedom has never tasted so sweet. You stretch your aching muscles and search nearby for your belongings, but there is little time to waste. Keeping a lookout, your rescuer whispers, “There may be a rowboat you can use on the top deck, but we’ll have to be quiet as mice. If they spot—” his voice suddenly catches in his throat, along with a sharp, jagged blade. He makes a dreadful gurgle as blood wells in his mouth, and he collapses. Behind him, a Corsair flashes a sadistic grin at his next victims: you.</p>"

Or perhaps not. For the sake of your own sanity, it may be better not to dwell on suspicions of betrayal.</p><p>“How does one even sail to the Moon?” you ask, befuddled. By now, you are no stranger to the oddities of the Dreamlands, having spent weeks exploring its cities, wilds, and places stranger still. Even knowing the laws of physics and astronomy should not apply here, you struggle to imagine how one might sail a ship into space.</p><p>“It will be a long journey,” Randolph answers. “Far across the sea lie the Basalt Pillars of the West. Between these pillars, the ocean plunges off the edge of the world. If we sail off of the precipice between them, we can cross the void of space itself.”</p><p>You shouldn’t be surprised that the world of Earth’s Dreamlands is flat; after all, everything else here is a fiction, too. Still, you are incredulous. “I have sailed this route before,” Randolph says, sensing your skepticism. “But I fear this time it might be a one-way trip, especially without a crew. We may need to find an altogether different way to unknown Kadath. Are you prepared?”</p><p>You look to the horizon, where the cerulean sea meets the sky. Somewhere out there, your aid is needed.

It is dressed in grey robes and heavy wrappings, but you see its true visage beneath: its slippery, clammy flesh and its drooling, bulbous lips. “Wonderful,” it praises its henchmen. “Our master will be pleased.” Behind you, Corsairs prevent your escape, while a row of winged things on either side of you squawk rhythmically and flap their wings.

You plead with him to aid you in your search for unknown Kadath, believing it to be of the utmost importance. “You should not seek to disturb the gods,” the man warns, his song interrupted. “They are far greater than you or I. Do you not see the folly in your ambition?” You beseech him once more, telling him you must bring back proof of the Dreamlands, and cannot return home without the aid of the gods. “Would that be so dire a fate? Look around you.”</p><p>You do as the captain requests, and are met with a scene of such serene beauty that it leaves you breathless.

You have come to see the Great Ones, upon whom it is unlawful for mortals to look.” The voice belongs to a tall, thin figure bedecked in the ornate prismatic robes of an ancient pharaoh, crowned with a golden pschent that glows faintly in the darkness. “What is it you expected to find?”</p><p>“Are you one of the gods who dwells in this castle?” Virgil asks, approaching the being. “Why is this place so dark and lonely?”</p><p>The regal figure permits an unhappy expression to flicker briefly over its countenance. “The gods you seek have fled their castle on unknown Kadath to dwell in another land, a land so marvelous they have forgotten how to be gods. Will you help me right this wrong?” the figure asks. Before Virgil can reply, it pulls its arm back and drives a razor- sharp blade of onyx through Virgil’s chest. His corpse slides to the polished floor, eyes forever frozen in tragic shock. The figure turns toward you, its shadow shifting into myriad shapes as it stretches across the ground. “No,” its many voices growl. “It is not enough.”</p>",
    "grandDesign4": "<p><b>Grand Design 4:</b> All the while, the black cat stays perched on your shoulder, watching with cold, narrow eyes. It is as if it has read this script many times before, but only now seen the actors play their parts. “I’m sorry, Virgil,” it says. Only it isn’t.</p>",

    "noResolution": "<p><b>If no resolution was reached because each investigator was defeated:</b> You startle awake, riveted and dazed by the magnitude of the dream that held your attention for so long. And yet, when you try to recall any of it, you remember very little. It is all a haze—like distant memories from decades ago. Just the hint of the dream remains. A black castle. A ship sailing through space. A staircase. A black cat. The only thing you remember is a voice in your head. A fundamental truth of the universe that you cannot shake from your memory. It speaks to you, even now, as you tremble under the hospital sheets: “Your dreams are mine!”</p>",
    "resolution1": "<p><b>Resolution 1:</b> The presence taunting your mind retreats into the shadows, and you are left once again with an overwhelming sense of loneliness. The vast halls of the onyx castle are evidence of nothing but despair and sorrow. Whatever gods once inhabited this place left long ago. Coming here was indeed folly. You carry Virgil’s corpse out into the snowy peaks of Kadath and bury him outside the castle. You still do not understand what the being known as Nyarlathotep wanted with him, or with you, but at least now you can leave the Dreamlands behind...if that is truly what you wish to do.</p>",
    "resolution2": "<p><b>Resolution 2:</b> There is nothing remaining of the presence that once taunted your mind. You are left once again with an overwhelming sense of loneliness. The vast halls of the onyx castle are evidence of nothing but despair and sorrow. But at least now they are no longer haunted by the being that lured you here. You understand now what its purpose was all along: to delve into your mind, discern your shape, and awaken alongside you. To become master of both dreams and reality at once. The black cat—whatever it truly was—must have seen this in its visions. You carry Virgil’s corpse out into the snowy peaks of Kadath and bury him outside the castle. With your quest complete, you have no reason to dwell in this place any longer. You can finally leave the Dreamlands behind...if that is truly what you wish to do.</p>",

    "resolution4": "<p><b>Resolution 4:</b> You think about the many journeys you have had in the Dreamlands and the fabulous things you have seen: the mystical forests, the beautiful palaces, the cerulean oceans. Had you ever experienced such wonders in the waking world? Could you really return to such a mundane life after what you have experienced here? Perhaps it would be better to stay. You can escape from this dreaded land of Leng and travel back to safer climes. You can live in the timeless realm of Celephaïs, where pleasures are abundant, and you will never age. Or perhaps live amongst the cats in the pleasant town of Ulthar where your quest began. Or explore the boundaries of the Dreamlands and see all of the marvels that it has to offer. Your mind is made up. You cannot return to the waking world, for you never want to leave.</p>",
    "resolution5": "<p><b>Resolution 5:</b> You recall what the black cat told you about your companions’ journey. Though you have no desire to leave the surface of the Dreamlands behind, there may be a way you can help your friends. You climb back down the northernmost peaks of Leng, returning to the domed ruins where you were confronted by Nyarlathotep’s high priest. There, in the center of the room, is the gaping pit that leads into the untold depths of the Underworld. Your companions are down there, somewhere...right?</p>"
