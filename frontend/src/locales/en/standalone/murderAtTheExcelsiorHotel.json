Sudden closures, sometimes for days at a time, seemingly without warning. It’s like something out of a ghost story, but you know better than to simply dismiss these rumors. Too many people have whispered about the Excelsior…and to make matters worse, it seems the stories have only grown more unsettling in the last week. It’s time somebody looked into it all.</p><p>You’ve tried going to the police, but the grizzled and world‑weary Sergeant Monroe has dismissed you every time. You’ve been left to investigate on your own. Asking around at all the local hot-spots yields no leads. Velma’s Diner, Hibb’s Roadhouse, La Bella Luna; Each visit leaves you with only more questions. That is, until today.</p><p>While walking down Central Avenue in Downtown, minding your own business, you bump into a man in a long trench coat. You begin to apologize, but he simply continues walking briskly away from you. It isn’t until you return home that you find the note in your pocket—one that wasn’t there before.</p><p class='center cursive'>*I have answers.*<br>*Room 225. Tonight. Come alone.*<br>*They’re watching!*</p><p>Uncertain of what else you can do at this point, you begin making preparations to meet this mystery person.</p>",

Hotel staff carry luggage and cleaning supplies throughout the lobby and the main stairway. The man behind the front desk greets you with a curt nod and a thin smile. A uniformed security guard reads the latest Arkham Advertiser in the corner. And yet, you can’t get the note’s final warning out of your mind. You stride quickly across the lobby and up the stairs, wondering if you should have let someone know where you were going. Was it wise to come alone? What if you’re walking into a trap? You set your jaw and clench your fists as you stand in front of the blood-red door to room 225, and before you can second guess yourself any further, you knock.

The entire time, you find yourself glancing to the coffee table in front of you, and the curved dagger that rests there. He pauses for a moment, pours himself a drink, and raises the glass to his lips with a shaky grip. He then pours a second drink and hands it to you. “This is all going to sound crazy,” he says, his voice little more than a whisper. He glances at every darting shadow and twitches at every creak the old building makes. “I’m beginning to feel crazy, but there’s too much going on here to just ignore. And I’ve been a part of it long enough…” You listen closely, but his words are starting to run together. His voice is ethereal and wispy, like wind at the end of a long tunnel. You blink rapidly. Your vision blurs. The next thing you know, you’re on your feet. Your glass drops to the floor, and then—</p><p class='basic right'>Proceed to _Setup_.</p>"

But do you have the evidence to back it up?</p><p class='basic'>Sergeant Monroe will only believe you if you collected enough evidence and did not try to cover up your involvement.

The entire building shakes to its foundations, and you hear guests screaming. “What in the hell?” He looks to the door, then to you. “Stay put,” he warns, “Or I swear, next time I see you, you’re gettin’ cuffed.” He runs off to investigate the noise, mumbling about how he is getting too old for this job.</p><p class='basic'>Remember that “the police don’t believe you.” Remove Sergeant Monroe from the game.

    "theTruth6": "<p>_The Truth 6_: Sergeant Monroe nods along to your story, convinced. “All right,” he says, “Sounds like you really did have nothing to do with this.
