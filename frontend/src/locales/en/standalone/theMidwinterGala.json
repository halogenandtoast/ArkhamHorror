It was the Yuletide, and I had come at last to the ancient sea town where my people had dwelt and kept festival in the elder time when festival was forbidden; where also they had commanded their sons to keep festival once every century, that the memory of primal secrets might not be forgotten.”</p><p class='right'>– H.P. Lovecraft, \"The Festival\"</p>",
    "body": "<p>A light snow falls as you step out of your taxi in front of the cracked and weathered facade of the old Kingsport manor. Several other guests—some of the finest movers and shakers from Arkham to New York—flitter past you to present their invitations to the doorman. As you follow them in, you catch a scent of cedar and sweet florals, with an undercurrent of something rank.</p><p>“The Lantern Club is thrilled to have you,” a grinning, sharp-eyed attendant says as they hand you the same bone-white mask worn throughout the soirée. Feeling out of place, you don your mask and follow an elderly flapper into a drawing room with a crackling fire. The room would be warm and inviting if not for an uncanny strangeness in the dreamlike paintings and ghastly sculptures. Looking at them makes your head swim.</p><P>“Please, please, if you’ll indulge me.” A stentorian voice bellows from an adjoining room. You follow the voice back to the lavish foyer. At the top of the stairway, a stately gentleman with a finely trimmed beard and alabaster mask raises his champagne glass. “I am Declan Pearce, nomarch of the Lantern Club. Follow me please.” The guests follow him through a wide set of double doors into the ballroom, in the center of which a gleaming gem is displayed behind a thick pane of glass. The socialites gather around, marveling at the swirling, iridescent colors that move like clouds within the hard cut angles of the Jewel.</p><p>“My honored guests. This is the Jewel of Sarnath,” Declan Pearce says triumphantly. “A stone unlike any other, rumored to have been cut in an ancient city on distant shores. Legends claim it can grant its bearer’s wishes.” Scattered laughter follows Pearce’s remark, and the chairman himself suppresses a chuckle. “Yes, yes, I know. Of course, the real purpose of this evening is you. We invited only the best, the most supreme of New England’s social strata, to appeal to your sense of charity. The most distinguished—or generous—among you may be permitted to hold the Jewel by the end of the evening. And who knows? Perhaps dreams are real, and the Jewel of Sarnath can grant wishes. But until then, enjoy our little party.”</p><p>After another wave of friendly laughter, Pearce claps his hands and a dozen attendants bearing mouth-watering appetizers descend upon the room. Your eyes scan the ballroom, hoping for some sign of the contact who led you here. A chill runs down your spine as you lock eyes with a tall, masked figure standing at the back of the crowd. He slowly cocks his head just a little too far to the right. You wonder if he is smiling behind his bone-white mask.</p><p>After what feels like ages, the man breaks eye contact with you to continue scanning the room. Suppressing a shiver, you search the gaggle of guests. Your gala invitation arrived in an unmarked parcel, along with a note promising generous compensation for your assistance in procuring the Jewel of Sarnath. At long last, you find your mysterious contact.",

Thank you for coming. I must admit, the university is more than a little curious to study this ancient gem.

Given the Jewel’s…colorful history, it would make quite the addition to the Lodge’s collection.\" The patriarch stares down his nose at you. \"Although I suspect that there is far more at play here than meets the eye. That is why I have asked you here. Acquire the Jewel for the Lodge, and you shall be rewarded with knowledge and riches beyond your wildest dreams.\" You ask him why the Lodge deserves the Jewel more than any other, and he smirks. \"We will keep it safe.

They call him ‘The Bloodless Man.’ Whatever the Lantern Club has planned for this evening is certainly his design.\" The captain sighs. \"No good can come of that strange Jewel. Only ruin.
