    "thePriceOfProgress1": "<p>_The Price of Progress 1_: “Ah, it’s you. I did not expect you to be here, though perhaps I should have,” Mr. Sanford says with a hint of surprise in his voice. “I regret that you had to be involved in this unfortunate affair. I did not plan for you to be a part of any of this.” You narrow your eyes. You suspect fortune had nothing to do with it. You ask him what will happen to those still trapped inside. “Human progress requires sacrifice,” he recites stoically. “It is lamentable when that sacrifice is in blood, but the price in lamentation does not outweigh the yield of our labor.”</p><p class='basic right'>Skip to _The Price of Progress 3_.</p>",
    "thePriceOfProgress2": "<p>_The Price of Progress 2_: “I regret that we must meet under such... unfortunate circumstances,” Mr. Sanford says offhandedly. You narrow your eyes. You suspect fortune had nothing to do with it. You ask him what will happen to those still trapped inside. “Human progress requires sacrifice,” he recites stoically. “It is lamentable when that sacrifice is in blood, but the price in lamentation does not outweigh the yield of our labor.”</p><p class='basic right'>Proceed to _The Price of Progress 3_.</p>",
    "thePriceOfProgress3": "<p>_The Price of Progress 3_: You didn’t come here to listen to Mr. Sanford proselytize about sacrifice. You came here for answers. You demand an explanation, but the elderly man cuts you off with a scowl. “Yes, yes. You speak of the incident last week. That was the creature’s first manifestation, and the arrival of the dark mist, which you encountered inside.” He glances at the front door to the manor and clears his throat. “The Lodge was not involved in the disappearances that occurred that night,” he explains after a short pause. “But we couldn’t exactly go to the police and tell them a creature made of mist kidnapped four people in Mr. Meiger’s household, could we? So, we had to take matters into our own hands. We suspected that creature was drawn to the crowd, so we recreated the incident in order to understand what happened—to discern its motives.” The decision to host another event at Mr. Meiger’s estate so soon after the disappearances makes sense to you now. As much as you hate to admit it, there is some logic to the plan the Lodge put into action, although you don’t particularly like being used as bait. Who knows how many innocent bystanders were put in mortal danger? Even if the goal was noble, was it worth the sacrifice?</p><p>“I hope you understand that our organization only seeks the betterment of humankind. There are harsh truths that lie beyond our five senses,” Mr. Sanford says, his expression grim. “If we are to survive and prosper, we must adapt. We must learn. We must understand. That is what our order seeks to achieve—a greater understanding of the world around us. A worthy pursuit, don’t you agree?”</p><ul><li>Check the _Silver Twilight_ enemies in the victory display and beneath the Entry Hall.<ul><li>If Josef Meiger is in the victory display, proceed to _The Price of Progress 4_.</li><li>If Josef Meiger is beneath the Entry Hall, skip to _The Price of Progress 5_.</li><li>If neither of the above is true, and the number of _Silver Twilight_ enemies in the victory display is equal to or greater than the number beneath the Entry Hall, proceed to _The Price of Progress 4_.</li><li>If none of the above are true, and there are more _Silver Twilight_ enemies beneath the Entry Hall than in the victory display, skip to _The Price of Progress 6_.</li></ul></li></ul>",
    "thePriceOfProgress4": "<p>_The Price of Progress 4_: Before you can reply, one of Sanford’s men emerges from the house behind you. He sheathes a long silver blade as he addresses Mr. Sanford. “There is no sign of Josef inside, sir.” The man eyes you suspiciously, keeping his hand on the hilt of his sword. His posture reminds you of that of a knight, stoic and rigidly disciplined. “I see,” Sanford replies. He closes his eyes and takes a deep breath before continuing. “A great loss for our order, but one we anticipated. Gather the Lodge’s belongings from inside the estate, and I will deal with the consequences.” The knight nods and heads back inside. Carl’s cold blue eyes turn back toward you. “As for you, I would ask you to leave this place at once. You have done enough harm as it is.” Before you can protest, he commands the other men nearby to escort you off the premises, and you have little choice but to comply.</p><ul><li>In your Campaign Log, record *Josef disappeared into the mist*.</li><li>In your Campaign Log, record *the investigators are enemies of the Lodge*.</li><li>The story continues in _Scenario III: The Secret Name_.</li></ul>",
    "thePriceOfProgress5": "<p>_The Price of Progress 5_: You consider Mr. Sanford’s words carefully. You believe that he is telling the truth, but you’re not sure if the ends justify his means. Before you can reply, Josef steps forward. “I believe our new comrades understand the value of working together,” he says politely, standing at your side. “They could have escaped on their own, but they stayed behind to make sure members of the Lodge were safe. Surely we are of the same mind.”</p><p>“Courage is not the same as sacrifice, Josef,” Carl Sanford intones patiently. “Do they have the will to do what is truly right for all of humanity?” The elderly man turns his attention back to you, his cold eyes glinting in the moonlight. He approaches calmly, extending his hand. “Regardless, you have experienced firsthand the danger that we all face. Join us, and we can face it together. With our knowledge combined, we can protect Arkham from this threat.”</p><ul><li>In your Campaign Log, record *the investigators rescued Josef*.</li><li>Each investigator earns 2 bonus experience, as he or she gains insight into the inner workings of the Silver Twilight Lodge.</li><li>The investigators must decide (choose one):<ul><li>“I refuse to be a part of this.” Skip to _The Price of Progress 7_.</li><li>“I agree.” Skip to _The Price of Progress 8_.</li><li>“I agree.” (You are lying.) Skip to _The Price of Progress 9_.</li></ul></li></ul>",
    "thePriceOfProgress6": "<p>_The Price of Progress 6_: You consider Mr. Sanford’s words carefully. You believe that he is telling the truth, but you’re not sure if the ends justify his means. Before you can reply, Josef Meiger emerges from the house behind you, flanked by two guards wearing expensive suits. One wields a long silver blade as he stands guard. The other observes the situation vigilantly, keeping one hand on the grip of a revolver holstered at his side. Josef recognizes you and addresses you curtly. “You have been poking your head where you don’t belong,” he threatens, narrowing his dark eyes. “Stay your tongue, Josef,” Sanford interjects. He approaches calmly, extending his hand toward you. “You have experienced firsthand the danger that we all face. Join us, and we can face it together. With our knowledge combined, we can protect Arkham from this threat.”</p><ul><li>In your Campaign Log, record *Josef is alive and well*.</li><li>The investigators must decide (choose one):<ul><li>“I refuse to be a part of this.” Skip to _The Price of Progress 7_.</li><li>“I agree.” Skip to _The Price of Progress 8_.</li><li>“I agree.” (You are lying.) Skip to _The Price of Progress 9_.</li></ul></li></ul>",
    "thePriceOfProgress7": "<p>_The Price of Progress 7:_ Mr. Sanford scowls, returning his hand to his side and narrowing his gaze. “I see. I cannot say I am not disappointed. I thought you would be insightful enough to see the value in working together. But I realize now that my confidence was misplaced.” He sighs and gazes past you, toward Josef ’s manor. “Very well. The Lodge will handle this problem on our own. Return to your state of ignorance. But I warn you: do not get in our way. I am not an enemy you want to have.” Before you can protest, Sanford commands the other men nearby to escort you off the premises, and you have little choice but to comply.</p><ul><li>In your Campaign Log, record *the investigators are enemies of the Lodge*.</li><li>The story continues in _Scenario III: The Secret Name_.</li></ul>",
    "thePriceOfProgress8": "<p>_The Price of Progress 8:_ You shake Mr. Sanford’s hand. His grip is cold, but strong. The other members of the Lodge seem to relax around you. “We will do great works together, my friends,” says Sanford. “Great works indeed.”</p><ul><li>In your Campaign Log, record *the investigators are members of the Lodge*.

    "youAreBeingHunted": "<div class='hunted'><div><img src='{setImgPath}/../hunted.png' /></div><div class='black'><h1 class='unquiet-spirits'>Do not read unless “You are Being Hunted”</h1><p> You are startled from your reverie by the sensation of something crawling up your chest, an icy hand that clasps around your throat. It grips until your breath is trapped and your windpipe starts to crack. Only there is nothing there—just a chilly draft entering the room through the open window. The wind shrill, whistling wind rattles your window frame, penetrating the safety of your home. It almost sounds like the dissonant notes of a dreadful flute: a mindless, haunting music that fills you with inexplicable terror. You rush to the window and slam it shut, hands trembling. Still, the thin, discordant notes echo around you. This can’t be real, you think. Not here, not now. But denial provides no asylum.</p><p>The cold creeps its way up your back once again. A thin, grey mist pours into the room, seeping beneath your front door and through the cracks around your window. It crawls along the ground and coils slowly around your ankles, sending shivers up your body. You run into your bedroom, slam the door, and lock it. A few seconds of respite are all you receive before the invader resumes its assault. Over and over, a heavy force slams against the door, shaking the entire room. You press against the door, trying to hold it shut. With each pounding crash, dark mist seeps through cracks appearing in the wood. With a final crash, the door shatters. You are hurled back, landing not on the floor but in a cloud of mist, gripped by a hundred spectral arms that cling into your flesh and tear you limb from limb.</p><p>NO!—That can’t be right. You are here, reading this very text. A wave of relief washes over you as you realize it is all in your head. Even so, the words compel your mind to torment you with visions of a macabre death. You find yourself glancing at your window, searching for dark mist that is not there. What if the text is trying to tell you something? Maybe—no, that’s impossible.</p><p>“Real or imagined, your fate approaches all the same.”</p></div></div>"
