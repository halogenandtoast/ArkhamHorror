The police are offering a substantial reward for any person or persons who come forward with information related to these disappearances. When asked whether the police were considering the case a homicide, Sheriff Engle had this to say: “There’s no reason to suspect foul play is involved just yet. However, given the circumstances, we have to consider every possibility.” No other attendees have come forward with statements concerning the gala, which seemed to finish without a hitch despite the disappearances.</p><p class='basic'>So far, none of the prominent members of the Silver Twilight Lodge have expressed any concern about the Lodge’s upcoming benefit dinner, which was recently moved to the same location: Josef Meiger’s estate in French Hill. “I am certain that this event will be a smashing success,” Mr. Meiger told the Arkham Advertiser in an interview yesterday. “There is no reason for the fair residents of Arkham to worry.”</p><p class='basic right'>–Minnie Klein</p>",
    "introPart2": "<p>You fold up the newspaper and shove it aside on your desk, examining the other files you’ve collected over the last few days concerning the missing persons. It has been several days since your experience in the woods. You have tried to put it all out of mind, but it is impossible. Every night, you dream of a nameless place in the void of space, a faint discordant melody of hypnotizing flutes pulling you forward. Now there are others disappearing from the town without a trace. The disappearances dance along the edges of your thoughts. No reason to worry, you ponder, turning the man’s words over in your head. You think of the card reader and her warning, and you wonder if you are simply imagining devils where there are none. Regardless, there is only one way to know for sure. You pick up the invitation, examining the silver-embossed stationary and perfect calligraphy.</p>",

While nobody is looking, you follow the handrail up and down the stairs until you spot what you are looking for: several splinters of wood, perhaps dislodged by a bullet. You ascend the staircase once more and position yourself where one would need to be standing in order to fire such a shot. After a moment of observation, a faint glimmer near one of the decorative ferns on the second floor catches your eye. There, you find proof: a bullet casing from a .45 handgun. A gun was indeed fired in the entry hall of the manor—but if that is true, how did nobody hear the shots?</p><p class='basic'>Under “Missing Persons,” next to Gavriella Mizrah’s profile, record *the investigators are on Gavriella’s trail*.</p>",

Perhaps he’s just a fastidious person...or perhaps he’s been scrubbing evidence of some wrongdoing. You find nothing of note in any of Josef ’s files, but after some perusing, you realize there is one place you haven’t checked: the trash. Rooting through the garbage bin yields fruit. Near the bottom is a small pocket journal belonging to Jerome Davids, probably tossed there carelessly by the cleaning staff. You turn to the last page. There, Jerome had recorded a list of names, perhaps transcribed from Josef ’s records. You don’t know what it means yet, but it must be important.</p><p class='basic'>Under “Missing Persons,” next to Jerome Davids’s profile, record *the investigators are on Jerome’s trail*.</p>",
    "penny": "<p class='basic'>If Penny White’s profile is not crossed off and there are no clues on the Balcony, read the following:</p><p>The balcony outside Josef Meiger’s bedroom overlooks the rainy streets and somber spires of French Hill. According to eyewitnesses, Penny was last seen entering Josef ’s bedroom, presumably to tidy it up, or perhaps to look for one of his personal belongings. The cigarette butt on the floor of the balcony tells a different story. Penny came here for a break, and judging from how busy the rest of the staff is, it was probably a much-needed one. If she had been in any danger, could she have climbed or jumped down from the balcony? You peer over the edge. It’s possible, but unlikely. A fall from here could break a leg, or worse. She likely would have retreated back into the manor, where she could have called for help...only, nobody saw her exit from the bedroom. Something doesn’t add up. You tuck the cigarette butt into your coat pocket, hoping it’s actually a lead and not a wild goose chase.</p><p class='basic'>Under “Missing Persons,” next to Penny White’s profile, record *the investigators are on Penny’s trail*.</p>",
    "valentino": "<p class='basic'>If Valentino Rivas’s profile is not crossed off and there are no clues on the Billiards Room, read the following:</p><p>Tracing Valentino’s steps isn’t difficult. As the guest of honor (and life of the party, from what you hear) there was always a crowd around him. This makes the story that he “vanished when they weren’t looking” all the more unbelievable. In the billiards room, where Valentino was last seen, you corner Adam Gensler, the man he was playing billiards with just before his disappearance. “Look, I already told the cops and the reporters what I saw,” he explains, fidgeting and tapping his toes repeatedly. “Tino and I were playing billiards, I looked away, next thing I know he’s gone,” he insists angrily, returning to his billiards game. “Now where is that damned one ball?” he mutters. It might be nothing, but it looks like Valentino wasn’t the only thing to go missing that night.</p><p class='basic'>Under “Missing Persons,” next to Valentino Rivas’s profile, record *the investigators are on Valentino’s trail*.</p>"
