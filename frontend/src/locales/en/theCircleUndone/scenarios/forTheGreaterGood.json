You shudder uncontrollably as your senses slowly return to you. This box is more dangerous than you could have imagined. In the hands of the Lodge, it could have been a powerful weapon, though you’re not sure what they intended to do with it. Just then, you hear several Lodge members approaching. You quickly shift one of the room’s bookcases aside and hide behind it before they enter the room. “You’re sure you heard something in here? I don’t see anybody,” one of them says.</p><p>“Hm…” the other pauses, presumably inspecting the room for signs of intruders. “Must have been nothing.”</p><p>“It’s all right. We’re all a bit on edge since the trap box went missing. Come, we don’t want to be late for the ceremony. Tonight is an important night.” Their footfalls become softer as they depart. The man’s words linger in your thoughts momentarily. What did he mean by tonight being an important night? This could be just as important as the puzzle box they had been attempting to open. You quietly follow the two men as they head deep into the tunnels beneath the Lodge. You struggle to keep up with them while trying to keep your footsteps silent on the stone floor of the passageway. Finally, they enter a large door with the familiar three arrows of Silver Twilight emblazoned along its surface. Ritualistic chanting fills the hall from the other side. You approach softly, placing your ear against the door to listen in.</p><p>“Brothers and sisters,” an elderly voice announces, “thank you for coming to this hallowed gathering. The time we have long waited for approaches.” You recognize the man’s voice – it is Carl Sanford, president of the Silver Twilight Lodge. “For many decades, the Order of the Silver Twilight has pursued knowledge that can elevate humanity. We have defended against threats to our very existence. We have sacrificed everything for this sacred cause. Now, one of these threats terrorizes our city, and once again we must do what has to be done in order to protect it.” The crowd responds with solemn approval. “Tonight, we will complete the ritual we began many nights ago at the center of the Unvisited Isle. Tonight, we will finally bind the revenant and learn what it knows. We must not allow the secrets of AZATHOTH to be lost to those who would do humanity harm.”</p><p>The cult replies with a monotone hymn, and you take this opportunity to flee the Lodge before you are discovered. The conspiracy you have unveiled leaves you with even more questions. If the revenant Mr. Sanford speaks of is what you think it is, binding it will surely protect Arkham, as he claims. But what knowledge do they seek to learn from it?…and what in the hell is an “AZATHOTH?”</p><ul><li>In your Campaign Log, record *the investigators discovered how to open the puzzle box*.

Somehow you were able to slay the creature, but the consequences were dire. Many Lodge members were gruesomely killed by the creature’s rampage before you were able to put it down. Worse, the device it emerged from was destroyed beyond recognition. You’re not sure whether it broke as a result of the beast’s emergence or as a result of its death, but either way, it is a regretful outcome. “This didn’t work as planned,” one of the robed members of the Order states matter-of-factly as you examine the crushed puzzle box.</p><p>“That’s a hell of an understatement,” another adds. She places a hand on your shoulder and gently pulls you away from the remains of the device. “Come on, that’s a lost cause,” she says.</p><p>Her partner ignores your presence and stoically addresses her. “We’ll have to get to the Unvisited Isle and complete the binding rite without the trap.” She nods and takes one last look at you before the remaining Lodge members flee the building.
