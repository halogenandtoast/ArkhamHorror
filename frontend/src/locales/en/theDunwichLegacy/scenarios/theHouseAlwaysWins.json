He’s not sure whether Dr. Morgan is in trouble, but he’s not particularly happy with his colleague’s present choice of company. He’s in the Clover Club, a notorious gambling joint somewhere downtown. Finding the club’s exact location isn’t easy—you have to grease a few palms just to learn which of the Downtown restaurants operates as the club’s front. That restaurant is La Bella Luna, a somewhat upscale Italian eatery by the theatre. You change into your Sunday best and make your way there.</p><p>In front of La Bella Luna stands a man in a pinstripe suit who sizes you up as you approach. “Enjoy yourselves,” he says with a snake-like grin as he holds open the restaurant’s front door.</p>"

As you make your way towards the street, a well-polished Chrysler B-70 rolls up to you, and a gorgeous woman with long brown hair and narrow eyes exits. She is flanked by dangerous-looking men who slip their hands under their suit jackets when they see you. “Peter,” she says with a sigh of relief, “Good, you’re okay. I heard there was trouble?” She turns and glares at you with deadly eyes. “Who are they?”</p><p>Mr. Clover dusts off his vest, unworried. “Naomi, my dear, these are friends of mine. They…” he clears his throat. “They escorted me off the premises,” he explains after a short pause. “They have earned our gratitude.” The woman crosses her arms and takes a moment to size you up before giving you a smirk.</p><p>“Very well then. I must thank you for taking care of Peter.
