After all that happened—Ichtaca, Alejandro, the city of the Yithians, Yoth—it turns out the true doom of humanity had occurred much, much earlier: when we first left to find the Eztli. We brought all of these events upon ourselves. In order to prevent this calamity, we had to seal the relic away forever. I remember these events as though I myself had experienced them, though for me, the expedition had gone much differently. We reached the central chamber of the Eztli ruins, but it was sealed shut, and nothing—not even the TNT that José had brought from the trucks—could breach the entrance. Although we returned to Arkham with proof that the Eztli existed, no other expedition would ever find them or their ruins again. My other self perished in those ruins—but I remember. Somehow, I remember everything.</p><ul><li>In your Campaign Log, record that *the investigators sealed the Relic of Ages forever*.</li><li>Each investigator earns experience equal to the Victory X value of each card in the victory display.</li><li>The investigators win the campaign!</li></ul>"
