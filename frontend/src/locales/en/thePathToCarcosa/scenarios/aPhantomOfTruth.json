    "intro1": "<p>_Intro 1_: Several months have passed since The King in Yellow came to the Ward Theatre. You and your companions have been investigating the strange incidents that followed in its wake. What you have found makes you question the wisdom of continuing your investigation, but the truth calls out to you, and you cannot help but answer. It seems you weren’t the first to piece together the strange happenings surrounding The King in Yellow. Another group of investigators had been researching these events as well. Just a matter of days after the performance in Arkham, they were admitted to the asylum, ranting about the King’s return and the “monsters” that had attacked them. Somehow this doesn’t surprise you. Their fate makes you all the more certain you are on the right trail... And all the more certain that you should stop while you still have the chance.</p><p>You’ve found the records those investigators kept before their incarceration, and picked up the trail where they left off. They had interviewed some of the cast and crew of The King in Yellow, and discovered several pieces of vital information. Their research also contains notes about their discoveries in Arkham’s Historical Society, and accounts from their time spent in the asylum, including interactions with a patient named “Daniel Chesterfield.” After a long night of compiling and comparing notes, you fall into a deep slumber. In your dreams, you are subjected to visions of Carcosa—its black stars, twin suns, shattered moons, and twisted spires.</p><p class='basic right'>Continue to _Dream 1_. Don’t get lost.</p>",
    "intro2": "<p>_Intro 2_: It has been several weeks since the events in the asylum, and you are still no closer to the truth about The King in Yellow and Carcosa. You have scoured the city for signs of the others Daniel had mentioned—the ones who are “opening the path to Carcosa”—but found nothing. Either the trail has gone cold, or they’re no longer in Arkham. Perhaps Daniel truly was insane, and you are only following him deeper down the rabbit hole. Every night, you toss and turn as you are subjected to vivid dreams of Carcosa­ —its black stars, twin suns, shattered moons, and twisted spires.</p><p class='basic right'>Continue to _Dream 1_.

Boys, take ‘em away.” Several other cops flank you and prevent any escape. Your protests go unheard as you are firmly escorted down a flight of concrete stairs and hurled into a cold jail cell. “Maybe some time in lockup will change your story,” the desk sergeant shouts.
