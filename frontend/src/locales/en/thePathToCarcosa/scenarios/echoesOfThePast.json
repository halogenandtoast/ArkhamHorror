The threat of the Stranger looms in your mind, and you find yourself glancing often at your rear-view mirror, expecting to see the expressionless visage of his mask haunting you. Instead, you see nothing but the misty, starless night, and the deserted road behind you.</p><p>Your thoughts once again wander, as they have often in the past few hours, to <span class='basic'>The King in Yellow</span> and to the city of Carcosa and its inhabitants. What was the message hidden inside that awful play, the meaning within its madness? A lone detail worms its way to the forefront of your thoughts, one made apparent by the discussions you’d overheard at Ms. Dumaine’s estate—that tonight’s performance of <span class='basic'>The King in Yellow</span> was not the first Arkham had seen of the foul play. There had been at least one other performance, directed by the same man: Nigel Engram.</p><p>There is one place in Arkham where records are often kept of important events occuring within the city: the Historical Society’s manor house in Southside. If there are any records of the previous show of <span class='basic'>The King in Yellow</span>, the Historical Society may have held onto them. Perhaps there you will find answers to the questions that burn in your mind.</p>",
