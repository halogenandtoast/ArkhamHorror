    "theFoundation1": "<p>_The Foundation 1_: “Talk,” the woman commands.</p><p>“I’m a detective with the ICPC,” Flint barks back. “Flint, Li Flint. And you’re going to be in a lot of trouble when they hear about this.”</p><p>“I assure you, I will not. And you?” she asks, glaring in your direction. You explain that you are independent investigators working with Flint. She takes a moment to read your gaze—presumably to tell if you are lying. She, like Flint, seems low on trust. Finally, after a long, bated moment, she holsters her firearm. Flint’s hands drop to his sides. You let out a breath you didn’t know you were holding.</p><p>“We have been after that red-gloved man for quite some time. This is the first time we have gotten this close. He seems to have a knack for slipping away.” She nods to the two suits flanking her—a tall, athletic, pale-skinned woman and a sharp, clean-shaven man—and motions toward the walls. They keep a hand on their holsters as they scour the perimeter of the room.“And who is ‘we,’ exactly?” Inspector Flint asks. You’ve been wondering the very same thing. Your interrogator has a British accent, but she doesn’t seem to be part of any local outfit you’ve ever heard of.</p><p>She waits for confirmation from her two subordinates before continuing. “All clear, ma’am,” the man states. She sighs and crosses her arms. “All right. What I am about to tell you cannot leave this room under any circumstances. Am I clear?”</p><p>Flint shrugs. “Under penalty of what, exactly?”</p><p>“Summary execution,” she states without hesitation. Your throat closes tight. Even your partner flinches for a moment.</p><p>“Well then. I suppose we don’t have much of a choice, do we?” He glances at you. You nod; you might as well hear what she has to say.</p><p>“I am Commissioner Taylor, and these are agents Hudson and Antonova. We are with the <span class='term'>Foundation</span>, an international agency devoted to the discovery, research, and containment of objects with paradimensional capability.”</p><p>“What kind of baloney?” Flint practically laughs. But the woman who calls herself Taylor shows no sign of humor.</p><p>“After the Great War, many treaties and accords were signed. Paris. Versailles. But keeping the peace wasn’t the only goal. There were…oddities, you see. During the war. Things that did not add up. The Foundation’s purpose is to find these ‘things that do not add up’ and ensure that they cannot be used for such purposes ever again.”</p><p>“Well, this is a hell of a con you buttons have cooked up,” Flint says, but the darker tone in his voice indicates he doesn’t even believe himself. And you’re inclined to agree—the fact that Commissioner Taylor even knows of the Red-Gloved Man at all is proof that she has inside knowledge.</p><P>You decide that it’s more likely she is telling the truth than lying, and ask what she intends to do with you.</p><p>She paces in uncomfortable silence before finally letting out a sigh. “Well, I certainly can’t have your investigation running parallel to my own. And you might have information that could be pertinent to our work. So I say we work together.”</p><p>“Work together? Or work for you?” Flint asks pointedly, his eyes narrowing.</p><p>She allows herself a smile. “You are a clever man, I’ll give you that.” She nods to Agent Hudson, who produces several badges and hands them to you. “You’ll be your own cell of the Foundation, operating under our authority, but with independence. All you need to do is agree to report your findings to us.” She locks eyes with Flint appraisingly. “You’ll be our point of contact.”</p><p>You ask Taylor what you get out of the arrangement, besides the lifted threat on your lives. “We’ll hand over the intel we have on the organization the Red-Gloved Man works for and provide travel papers that can get you anywhere in the world, no questions asked, at no expense.”</p><p>Flint eyes the badge like one might an explosive, turning it over and over in his hands. “Two minutes ago you were pointing a gun at me, now you’re offering me a job?”</p><p>“Yes. Well? Are you in?”</p><p>You pull Flint aside to speak with him in private. The discussion is short and hushed, full of conjecture and paranoid theories about this “Foundation” and their true motives. But in the end, you decide to accept her offer. If it will help you get to the bottom of whatever is going on, it is the only real choice.</p><p>“Very well then,” Taylor explains. “The Red-Gloved Man is just one operative of his organization. Or, perhaps, its leader—that we are unable to determine. They call themselves the <span class='term'>Red</span> <span class='term'>Coterie</span>, so named due to the red garments they wear. They are after artifacts scattered across the world which possess paradimensional capabilities—the very same kind of objects we seek to find and contain. We call them Keys.”</p><p>You ask Commissioner Taylor what she means by the term paradimensional. “Imagine a cake with many layers,” she explains. “Everything we see and feel exists on one layer. But there are many more layers above and below ours. Something that is paradimensional exists on one layer, but draws energy from other, parallel layers. As a result, these Keys operate outside the laws of our dimension. Cause and effect. If left unchecked, they can be used to inflict terrible harm on the world. Our job— your new job—is to get them out of the hands of the Coterie and keep them secure in Foundation custody.”</p><p>If these Keys are as powerful as the Foundation believes, you agree that they should be kept in safe hands. But you cannot help but wonder what this has to do with the disappearances you’ve been investigating, if anything. Flint locks eyes with you and gives you the slightest shake of his head. He has no intention of telling them.</p><p>The investigators must decide (choose one):</p><ul><li>*Tell Taylor about the disappearances*. Proceed to The _Foundation 2_.</li><li>*Do not tell Taylor about the disappearances*. Skip to The _Foundation 3_.</li></ul>",

Inside, a bored attendant slumps behind a desk near a brass elevator. Punching a specific code, the elevator takes you deep underground, farther than you could have predicted. On –14F, you step out and are greeted by an imposing man in a well-tailored suit and black fedora. “Archibald Hudson. We met in London,” he reminds you. “Your cell is quite the talk around the office.” The agent leads you down a seemingly endless hallway lined with alcoves. Each alcove displays something different: a model of a hollow earth, a crystal skull, a map with ley lines and other unknown markings. You pause and look at a half-eaten ear of corn, still steaming.</p><p>“From what I hear, that corn’s been cooked to perfection for the last two decades. So’s the dame who was eating it,” Agent Hudson says grimly. Looking at the paradimensional relics gives you a headache. Your eyes struggle to focus on them: they are both there and not there at the same time. Hudson ushers you down a side hall into a boxy room crammed with metal filing cabinets and sits down behind a heavy wooden desk. He speaks into a ring-and-spring microphone: “File #26–G2. Interview conducted by Hudson, Archibald, designation 42a6-951. That’s Agent Hudson to you,” he arches an eyebrow. Over the next several hours, you answer a gauntlet of grueling questions about your experience thus far, ranging from the past day to your experience in London. When it’s all done, Agent Hudson leans back and lights a cigarette. “I’ll admit, I was skeptical about you from the start.

After identifying yourself, you are led into a long well-lit hallway with lavish carpeting.</p><p>“It seems you follow instructions well,” says a voice. You turn to see a tall, athletic woman in a well-tailored suit. “Valeriya Antonova. We have met before. Call me Lera. Please, follow me.” Agent Antonova leads you through a labyrinthine set of passageways, past a set of double doors, to a white-tiled room flecked with grime and what you hope is red rust. On an operating table in the center, what looks like a person is strapped to a metal slab, restrained with tight leather straps. Looking at the humanoid shape makes your head swim: its features are blurred as if in constant motion, like a hummingbird in flight. You catch only glimpses of its features: a stygian eye, clenched teeth, nervous twitching.</p><p>“Lera,” another agent interrupts. “The Komissar needs your attention.” Agent Antonova looks sternly to you. “This is a paradimensional being. Please keep your distance. I will be but a moment away.” The agent leaves. As you look at the sharp implements mounted to the wall of the lab, you wonder what experiments the being has endured. Judging by the subject’s well-tailored black suit, you wonder if it used to be a Foundation agent. After a minute of silence, it begins to flail around on the table, widening and shrinking its “mouth” to a wide dark O, always facing you. You keep your distance, trying to look away.</p><p>“Please excuse me,” Agent Antonova re-enters the room. The being on the table stops flailing. “There is another matter I must attend to.

Taylor gathers the cards up. “I win this time, but I look forward to our next game,” she sips her drink. “Do not forget what I said.

He narrows his eyes at your stare. “Answer me,” he says, scanning his surroundings.</p><p>You assure him that you haven’t been followed. “Can’t be too careful. Eyes everywhere.

Then you spot other tourists taking photos as well, and you realize that Flint is better at blending in than you are. “The last time I saw the lady with the parasol, she was leaving a meeting between several wealthy British and Chinese businessmen—railway men,” he says quietly, head still down. “Women aren’t usually allowed at such meetings. Nor are regular citizens. To be in that room, you have to be able to get the attention of those powerful men. Which means you’re either very powerful, or obscenely wealthy.” Flint takes a few photos, then moves to a new spot and starts the tedious process of focusing the camera all over again. “Within two weeks of that meeting, they announced a lucrative new contract. It seems all their competitors were convinced for one reason or another to step away from the project, which left them to write their own ticket. Name their own price.” He slowly scans the courtyard again, careful to move just his eyes and not his head. “Could be she has leverage on them. Or maybe she’s just that charming.

You try your best to reassure Quinn, but she is right—this could easily be a wild goose chase or a trap. Commissioner Taylor would certainly not be happy if she knew her agents were attempting to parley with a member of the Red Coterie.

Now is as good a time as any to give it a shot. Worst case scenario, you’ve simply wasted your time, and Quinn’s. You put the whistle to your lips and blow. Emerging is a paradoxically distant sound, a warbling trill not unlike the shrill sound that has haunted you ever since Kathmandu. The wind picks up, sudden and chill. Quinn pulls her coat over her torso with a shudder. Then, arriving just as swiftly as the bitter wind, you spy her.</p><p>Aliki Zoni Uperetria stands just over the ancient temple ruins, her red sash a splash of flowing color in the harsh breeze. As the wind and the discordant whistle both fade, her hair settles over her face, obscuring her expression. “I hope you know what you’re doing,” Quinn murmurs to you under her breath as she approaches the haunting figure with much trepidation. The girl in the scarlet sash speaks a single word in ancient Egyptian, stopping Quinn in her tracks. The agent replies in kind, causing Aliki’s head to tilt to the side in curious understanding. Slowly, bit by bit, the two begin to converse, changing languages every other sentence like two students testing one another. You watch in awe as the two juggle ancient languages as easily as breathing.</p><p>Finally, Quinn addresses you. “You were right. She’s searching for a place where…” Aliki speaks again, and Quinn translates. “The entities you’ve encountered. She thinks the things they take—no, devour—she thinks they end up somewhere else. She’s searching for the place where they go.” You ask Quinn if she can think of any place on Earth that might be a hotspot for such activity. “There is one that I can think of,” she replies. “The Bermuda Triangle, otherwise known as The Devil’s Triangle, in the Atlantic. We’ve tried our best to keep it under wraps, but a lot of ships and even some aircraft have gone missing in that area. A few of those incidents are on my list of memory anomalies, as well. Could be some kind of…gateway.”</p><p>You tell her to ask Aliki why she is looking for this place, and the two begin conversing again. “She says that she thinks some of the Coterie were—” She pauses for a moment, struggling with the translation. “—taken? But how could that be? Our records indicate they’re accounted for. At least, the ones we know about.” You consider all that you have seen, and a nauseous feeling overtakes you. Is it possible for both to be true? Is it possible some in the Coterie are not what they seem?</p><p>You approach and ask Aliki if she would like to travel with you to this gateway, if it exists. Quinn tentatively translates your request, and the mysterious figure nods in response. Resolve, strange and fierce, like a piercing light in the abyss, fills your heart. You lift the raven whistle and say that you will summon her when you are ready. This time, Aliki nods without even waiting for Quinn’s translation. You catch just a glimpse of piercing red eyes, framed with heavy bangs, as the wind picks up again and sends her hair aflutter. You lift your coat to block the bitter chill, and naught but a moment later, Aliki Uperetria is gone, wisped along with the wind itself.</p><p>You ask Quinn if she will stick with you a little longer. “I’m not going to lie, this terrifies me,” she says in a small voice, “but I think we are on to something here. Yes. I will see this through with you to the very end. I just hope…” she quivers and averts her gaze away from you. “I just hope I am still remembered when this is done.</p><ul><li>In the Americas section of the Campaign Log, inside the Bermuda Triangle (*the triangle formed by lines connecting Ybor City, San Juan, and Bermuda*), write “56–Y.” You are now able to travel inside the Bermuda Triangle whenever you embark.

Luckily, you have a lead just north of the bay: a quiet, run-down building with an adjoining boarded-up warehouse. If you didn’t know the truth, you’d think it was nothing more than an out- of-date factory from the ’80s, probably filled with nothing more than dust and rats. But if you’ve learned anything in your travels, it’s to never trust the evidence of your eyes.</p><p>You cautiously approach the main entrance and attempt to open it. As you suspected, it does not budge. If this is truly a Coterie sanctum, it’ll be harder than that to get inside. There’s no easy way in through the third- story windows, so you circle around the side of the warehouse, spotting a large metal door likely used for loading goods or unloading supplies.

Last thing you need is a bullet in the back just as soon as you begin your search. As if sensing your concern, he slowly unholsters his gun and empties the cylinder. “Look, friend.

Any friend of his is a friend of mine,” he states, meeting your suspicious gaze head-on. “Whatever you’re looking for, it’s yours.”</p><p>It doesn’t take too long for you to find the Key Desi had stashed here. Mounted on a far wall of the warehouse, over a midst of a trove of supplies and ammunition, its alien sheen reflects a warped view of your startled countenance.

To the north, the Himalayas loom over the city, only their peaks illuminated by the westward sun. Pinks and purples bathe the sky in vibrant beauty. You could stare at such a breathtaking sight forever…but you have a job to do. Despite the quiet, peaceful evening, that soft, sharp piping does not cease, like an aching sense of dread in the back of your mind. As the evening drags on and the whistling grows louder, you realize you are the only one who can hear the strange sound. It feels as though it is reaching out to you directly. As if it hears you, too. As if it knows you. On a whim, you close your eyes and strain yourself to listen closer. It’s difficult to tell where exactly the sound is coming from—it seems to waft all around you and echo throughout the streets—but it grows in volume as you round the nearest corner and head north. And so north you continue.</p><p>Eventually, you reach an art gallery nestled between several age-old buildings. The whistling here is fevered and unpleasant, like a boiling kettle. Though the gallery is closed at this late hour, you are able to easily find an open side entrance. You brace yourself and enter the gallery, where dozens of Nepalese sculptures and paintings are on display—many carved out of wood or stone, others made out of ashtadhatu, an amalgam of eight different metals, and still others made of terra cotta. The whistling suddenly stops the moment you reach the rearmost section of the gallery, where a single lot remains strangely empty. There is no trace of what might have been there; just an empty space where something historic and treasured is clearly meant to be. Then, a lone voice pierces the sudden quiet, speaking in a language you do not understand.</p><p>You turn on your heels, body tensing. On the other end of the hall is a girl dressed in white, her figure seemingly ethereal in the faint beams of fading sunlight that permeate through the building. Her long black hair is draped over her face, masking her expression. A long scarlet sash wrapped around her waist flutters behind her, despite the fact that there is no breeze.</p><p>You freeze. The figure of the girl does not move. Her hair and sash drift steadily in the stillness. Then, she speaks once more. Again, you don’t understand a single word of it, though you notice that she has switched languages. Recognizing a few root words, you realize she is using Latin. She speaks again, this time in what sounds like ancient Greek. If she is trying to communicate with you, it may be wise to play along. You ask her what she is doing here; why she guided you here.

As you attempt to decipher her intent, she approaches slowly, her steps making no sound whatsoever along the wooden floor. She gestures to the empty lot next to you and whistles softly, as though the sound might carry with it some meaning. You wonder if perhaps there might have once been something here, and then realize: it is gone, vanished from history without so much as a trace. You recall the woman’s name from the Foundation’s dossier and ask her if she is also on the trail of the entities responsible for these kinds of disappearances. Aliki Uperetria does not seem to understand you, but she tilts her head in recognition at the sound of her own name.

You ask what she is after, and what the significance of the whistle is, but she remains cryptically silent. Turning over the whistle in your hand, you find no markings or clues as to its purpose. When you glance back up to question Aliki, she has vanished, replaced once more with a cold wind that seeps into your skin.

I am hardly the mover and shaker I once was in the Coterie. Now, their concerns seem trivial in comparison with all the great work that must be done.”</p><p>When you ask about his great work, the professor smiles. “It is the work of every person.

Masai shows you several complicated graphs and charts.</p><p>“The lakebed here is covered in the ruins of a sunken city built long ago. I happened upon it when monitoring acidity and chemical levels. Something was increasing—or perhaps better put: producing—an incredible amount of carbon dioxide. Along with several odd mutations in local fauna and flora.

She’s not just taking these jobs because they pay well. Time and again she goes for these deals where she can help the British at the expense of the common folk.

Your skin goes suddenly numb, and you collapse to the ground. The painful pinprick sensation of a sleeping limb takes over your entire body. Tzu San Niang smiles, puts her parasol over her shoulder, and walks away. She gets a few yards away and, apparently believing she is out of earshot, she tells her entourage: “We are done here.

Her silver tongue and negotiating skills are apparently the thing of legend: she can convince worker unions to tolerate abysmal conditions, local governments to accept the extraction of natural resources without batting an eye, and worse.</p><p>“We can’t be too careful,” Flint warns. “Obviously, Ms. Tzu is no one to be trifled with, but it’s that parasol that’s the key to her operation, if you’ll pardon my pun.

You do your best not to let your familiarity with such events show on your face. “Any of this mean anything to you?”</p><p>You don’t like lying, but telling the truth now would reveal your earlier deception to Taylor. You shake your head, telling Quinn this is new to you. “That checks out. See, that is what’s so hinky about all this. You are holding the only surviving records of any of these places. It is as though all of them were completely eradicated from history. And if that is true, who is to say the same could not happen to us?” She shudders. “The thought of being forgotten like that…even by those closest to me…it is my worst fear.”</p><p>You tell Quinn that you feel similarly, and that you wish you had more intel to give her. Her gaze, narrow with suspicion, sees right through you.</p><p>“I do not buy that for a second. Taylor might trust you, or maybe she just does not want to get her hands dirty. But I can tell when someone is lying to my face.” A grim silence hangs in the air. Finally, she exhales. “Fine. Do as you will. But if you decide to spill, you can find me in Amesbury, due west of London,” she says, packing some of her files and personal belongings in a small canvas duffel bag. You repeat her destination, curious as to why.</p><p>“Something there I want to look into,” is all she gives you. You suppose it is only fair, considering your hesitance to give her the full story. She gives you no more than a cold glance as she leaves, and you wonder if perhaps you should have warned her. But what she doesn’t know can’t hurt her…right?</p><ul><li>In your Campaign Log, record *Agent Quinn does not trust the cell*.</li><li>In the North Atlantic section of the Campaign Log, find London.

    "deadAndGone1": "<p>_Dead and Gone 1_: You arrive in London and follow Agent Quinn’s directions to get to the town of Amesbury. Immediately after checking into a hotel, your concierge wordlessly hands you a note with an address by the side of a park on the western side of the historic town. You head there immediately, only to find Agent Ari Quinn sitting in the driver’s seat of a Bentley, reading a newspaper and not paying you any heed. Without making a scene, you silently climb into the passenger seat. “Finally. Been waiting here all day.” You’re not even sure how Quinn knew you’d arrived in town, but you suppose the Foundation must have eyes and ears all over every harbor and border checkpoint. You ask her what she’s been up to, and what she wanted to show you, at which point she starts the Bentley’s engine and rolls along the road to the west. “You’ll see.” Just a short drive later, you come to a familiar sight. You should have known— Quinn has taken you to the site of mysterious and prehistoric Stonehenge. A ring of standing stones marks the site, inside which another ring of smaller bluestones seem to serve no particular purpose whatsoever. A few tourists peruse the monument in awe, but it is otherwise quiet. You follow close behind and ask Agent Quinn why she asked you to come all this way. “Strange place, is it not?” she asks. A rhetorical question—historians have long debated over the likely function of the landmark, but none know for certain. As you draw nearer, she points to the various standing stones and to the concentric ring of smaller stones inside. “Almost seems like something is missing.”</p><p class='basic'>Check the Campaign Log.</p>",

Still going to play it tight-lipped?” She heads to the center of the bluestone ring and takes out a small contraption possessing a series of lights along its surface. It lets out several beeps, rising in frequency as she reaches the very center. “Yeah, that just about confirms my suspicions…but I’m still missing the why. So, enlighten me, since you seem to know more than I do: what the hell could have made part of a structure vanish not just from existence, but from recorded history as well?”</p><p class='basic'>The investigators must decide (choose one):</p><ul><li>*Tell Agent Quinn the truth*.

She listens intently, hanging on every word. “So these things, these… let us presume to call them ‘extraterrestrials,’ when they take something, it vanishes completely. Do you understand what this means?” You know a great many conclusions that could be drawn from these events, but you encourage her to continue on her own. “Everything we know, everything we can see, it’s just what’s left. Look at Stonehenge. We have no earthly clue what it is. Maybe that’s because it’s incomplete. There could have been dozens of other structures erected right where we stand and humanity would never know.” She paces back and forth, agitated. “This is my life’s work. I’ve studied these kinds of events for over a decade. Paranormal disappearances. Dead civilizations. Bloody hell, I’m fluent in a dozen dead languages. I’ve always assumed these events are a small slice of pie missing from the greater whole. But what if we’re only seeing what’s left—the tiny slice of pie these creatures haven’t stolen?”</p>",

It’s only a couple miles back to Amesbury. I’ll find another ride.” You try to reason with her, but she remains stoic. “If you have nothing to tell me, I have nothing to say to you, either.

Roanoke Island. Angkor. You get the idea.” She stands and taps the device against the palm of her hand as she scans the stone rings. “These things you mentioned in your report, these—let us presume to call them ‘extraterrestrials’—when they take something, it vanishes completely.

    "deadAndGone6": "<p>_Dead and Gone 6_: Suddenly, what Agent Quinn just said snaps you to attention. Quinn is an expert in long-dead languages and ancient civilizations. You ask her if she’d be willing to help you with a related matter far from Amesbury. “If it will help me get to the bottom of this, then yes,” she replies eagerly. “What can I do for you?” With bated breath, you tell her it might require her to not inform the Foundation of her next whereabouts. She takes a moment to consider the implications, then nods, resolute. You hand her the whistle Aliki gave to you and tell her that it belonged to a Coterie member who seemed to know only Latin, ancient Greek, and other languages you could not decipher. She studies it for a long while, turning it over and over in her hand. “A white raven,” she murmurs to herself. “The Greek myths tell us that ravens were the messengers of the Gods; Apollo in particular. They were once all white, but when Apollo sent one to spy on his lover, Coronis, he learned of his lover’s infidelity and scorched the raven’s wings black in anger.” You ask Agent Quinn if there is any place in the world one might associate with Apollo or his raven. “There are temples in Rome dedicated to the god Apollo,” she says. “Apollo Sosianus and Apollo Palatinus. Let me know if you head there. I’ll meet you.”</p><ul><li>In your Campaign Log, record *the cell is off-mission*.</li><li>Each investigator earns 1 experience, as they gain insight into the strange happenings around the world.</li><li>Mark 1 _time_ in your Campaign Log.

A whirlwind first day sees you visit various temples, curio shops, and bazaars. Bright orange flowers hang by strings from bamboo racks as you make your way through a bazaar toward the Colaba Causeway, where the Gateway of India looks out onto the waterfront. As the day turns to evening, you continue to explore back alleys and side streets lit by delicately inlaid bronze lamps. The air is thick with unknown scents and hazy shapes as you lose yourself in the heady atmosphere of the old city.

If not for the distinct, black windows and the harsh lines, you might not have remembered it. As you scan the façade, the frieze overhanging the door stands out to you.

Over the door is a slate frieze that depicts a cast of mythological figures: some recognizable, some not. The building itself looks out of place amidst the intricate architecture of the surrounding area. The look of the building makes you feel vaguely uneasy the longer you study it. There is a coldness, a sharpness to the building’s design, accentuated by jagged quoins and harsh angles. Something about the wide, black windows, the dark interior, denotes the emptiness of a hollow skull.

Advertisements for a production of a play named “Ödestimmen” paper the alleys and stops surrounding Stockholm’s largest theatre. You follow the cobblestone streets around Stockholm’s old town district, which the locals tell you is called “the town between bridges.” The winding narrow paths loop in on themselves and cross at odd angles to form a labyrinth of crumbled mustard-yellow alleys and worn façades. You pass a row of distinctly painted rowhouses overlooking the town square. As you sit down and watch locals come and go, you feel a great weight lift from you, if only for a moment.

    "metamorphosis2": "<p>_Metamorphosis 2_: At first, you are concerned that nobody recognizes Dr. Irawan’s name, but after some persistent questioning, a reluctant local offers to lead you to her. Heading into the dense underbrush, you follow a steep path up a nearby mountain until you reach a dark hollow. Leaning against the trunk of an ironwood tree, you find the zoologist peering intently into the shadows.</p><p>“I did not expect you to follow me here,” Dr. Irawan whispers. Following her lead, you sit down next to her and peer into the dark. The air around you is thick and moist. “My theory was…incorrect. Or at least, partially incorrect.” From your vantage point, you can see into a shallow dell cut by a cascading waterfall. The moon shimmers on the ripples of a narrow stream. Dr. Irawan continues: “All trace of this particular cuscus is gone, that much is for certain. The locals have no memory of them. But something is different about the disappearance. Something lingers.”</p><p>A low, moaning wail from somewhere in the trees startles you. Dr. Irawan holds out a pair of binoculars and points at a cluster of ironwood trees on the far side of the glade. Peering through, you spy three cat-sized marsupials with yellow eyes clinging to a branch, curled tails swinging in the dark. They are feeding on something. Just looking at them makes your head spin: something about them is both there and not there at once, forcing your eyes to constantly adjust. The animals’ movements are stiff and double-jointed as well, both too fast and too slow. You look away.</p><p>“You see them?” asks Dr. Irawan. You nod and look again: the cuscus are messily devouring a green python. “It is fascinating. A fundamental change. The prey have become predators. The few I have observed have made a complete shift in behavior, turning on other cuscus, hunting their own natural predators—of which the green python is one. Their very nature seems to have changed!” Dr. Irawan stammers excitedly. “But more importantly, they aren’t gone. I mean: they have gone, to some. Nobody remembers them. But yet they persist.”</p><p>You turn your binoculars back to the cuscus to find them frozen: staring straight at you with their bright, topaz eyes. Surprised, you drop the binoculars. When you look again, the cuscus are gone. Suddenly on edge, you tell Dr. Irawan it would be best to leave, but she shakes her head. “I am on the verge of the greatest discovery of the century. An entire field of para-zoological research. I cannot leave now.”</p><p>Leaving Dr. Irawan to her own devices, you head back into town. The jungle around you is eerily silent, and even as you break into a moonlit clearing, you cannot help the feeling of being watched.</p><p>Over the next few days, you make contact with the zoologist in passing. The day your ship is scheduled to leave Manokwari, Dr. Irawan is suspiciously absent from the guest house. The staff tell you she didn’t return the night before. Concerned for her safety, you return to the hollow where you met her before. The jungle retains the same unsettling quietude as you hike up the mountain.</p><p>Scattered on a rock overhanging the dark hollow are several torn-up sketchbooks and a broken pair of binoculars, but no trace of Dr. Irawan. Scanning the murky copse, you see a glimmer of light and the zoologist’s batik vest at the base of the waterfall. You carefully pick your way down the muddy slopes to the bank of a narrow stream where the zoologist lays prone, her arm bent at an odd angle. A trio of yellow-eyed cuscus scatter as you approach. Turning her over gently, you are relieved to find her still breathing. A strange black implement is clutched in her left hand, close to her chest.</p><p>A mordant call resounds from above. Dr. Irawan is surprisingly light as you scoop her up in your arms. Dozens of yellow eyes glare down at you from the ironwood trees as you carry the zoologist downstream, away from the hollow. Flitting, shimmering forms dart to and fro overhead like silent warnings.</p><p>As soon as you get back to town, you check the unconscious zoologist into a clinic. The ship you had booked has already left, but with the strange circumstances you found her in, you resolve to stay with Dr. Irawan until she wakes up. Several days pass, filled with disquieting silence, until she finally speaks.</p><p>“I noticed several cuscus gathered around this,” she thumbs the hollow bell in her good hand. “I knew better than to interfere. But they seemed so fixated on it. Much like magpies or crows will hoard certain objects. So strange. I noticed they stowed it in the crook of a branch and, so I climbed up for a better look and—well, that’s when I fell,” she says.</p><p>You hold the strange chime in your hands, appreciating its heft and form. The inlaid designs are like nothing you or the zoologist have ever seen. The metal is cool to the touch yet strangely electric. On a whim, you hold the bell up and swing it once, even though it doesn’t have a clapper. A palpable wave of sonic energy ripples through the air around you. From the trees, you can hear a familiar mournful cry.</p><p>“This has become more than a simple survey,” Dr Irawan whispers. “Whatever those creatures have become, they are no longer Phalanger septimus. Something changed.” The zoologist pauses and considers her words for a moment, then smiles at you. “Whatever is happening, I—I would prefer to not work alone. Perhaps I could continue my research with you?”</p><p>You tell Dr. Irawan you wouldn’t have it any other way, and agree to stay with her as she recovers. The zoologist entrusts the strange bell to you.</p><ul><li>In your Campaign Log, record *Dr. Irawan joined the cell*.

You wait until you spot him leaving the sanctum and then start picking the lock of the same entrance…only, to your surprise, he has left it unlocked. You can almost imagine his blank stare from the shadows, mocking your every move. Does he know you’re here? Why steal from you only to hand the stolen objects back to you on a silver platter? In the end, you decide it is best to not look a gift horse in the mouth—after all, you’re not about to waste this opportunity. You grab the stolen relic and make your escape, wondering all the while the true motivations of the mysterious man.</p>@:theScarletKeys.rusesAndReclamation.continue </div>",

It’s likely he has set guards inside the safehouse, as well. Sneaking is probably out of the question, so you decide on a quick, direct approach: take the guards by surprise, grab what’s yours, and get out before they can respond with force. The job is clean and over in a matter of seconds. With the knight’s enforcers surely on your tail, you flee the city as fast as you can with your prize in tow.</p>@:theScarletKeys.rusesAndReclamation.continue </div>",

You count yourself lucky to have been out of your hotel room when it was sacked, or you would surely be dead. But from your mission in Alexandria, you know the creature has a weakness—it must hibernate from time to time. Quiet as a mouse, you slip into its sanctum unnoticed, the Beast’s rumbling breath emanating from a chamber deeper beneath your feet. Your heart races as you creep throughout the building, knowing any false step could spell your doom. The moment you grab the stolen artifact, the Beast begins to stir, and you rush to the exit. Even after putting miles between you and the creature’s lair, you can still hear its howls of anger and hate.</p>@:theScarletKeys.rusesAndReclamation.continue </div>",

You’ve tracked her down enough times by now to know her modus operandi perhaps better than any other living person. It’s even starting to become a little fun, this tête-à-tête. You sneak into her sanctum and locate the relic in a hiding place not unlike where a remnant of the Weeping Lady was found during your last encounter. With a bit of a chuckle, you replace it with a little calling card of your own and escape without notice. As you leave the city later that night, a bystander slips a red envelope onto your person, bearing a message: “Nice one. Let’s play again some time.”</p>@:theScarletKeys.rusesAndReclamation.continue </div>",

You move carefully under the cover of night, hoping to avoid detection. The man’s sanctum is more akin to a workshop, filled with torturous implements and strange, arcane tools. Among the many instruments is that which he stole from you, placed in the center of one of his workbenches as though he was studying it. The moment you grab it and move to escape, you hear his startled voice from another doorway. “Who is there?” Two empty eyesockets glare in your direction as you turn to face him. “Who is that?” He scrambles to find his ruby spectacles, but you are long gone before he is able to put them on.</p>@:theScarletKeys.rusesAndReclamation.continue </div>",
    "amaranth": "<div class='red bordered'><p>_If Amaranth stole the Key(s)_: You sneak into Amaranth’s sanctum and find what she stole piled in the corner of a cavernous foyer. A weak roar breaks the silence, and you see a tattered lion glowering at you from the dark. Your shock turns to disgust as you watch the poor creature struggle to stand: it is too decayed to even move. “You got what you came for. Now leave,” says a voice from the shadows. Squinting your eyes, you see Amaranth bent over the lion, her cheeks wet with tears. “Khalid, please,” she whispers. The lion lets out a weak growl, then flops onto its side to expose its rotten belly. “I told you to leave!” Amaranth screams. Your disgust turns to pity as you make your exit.</p>@:theScarletKeys.rusesAndReclamation.continue </div>",

Not just empty, but abandoned entirely, perhaps for many years before you ever arrived. You wander through darkened halls and dusty, cobwebbed chambers, until finally you reach an old, decrepit bedroom. A full-length mirror adorns one wall, covered in dust and grime. Spotting a strange reflection in the glass, you wipe away the filth, revealing the haunting figure of Aliki behind you, her long, dark hair covering her eyes as she reaches for your neck. When you turn again, she is gone, but the feeling of something clenching around your neck remains. Spying your stolen Key on a nearby vanity, you snatch it and run, bursting through the door of the sanctum with a resounding thud. You don’t stop running until you have left the city behind.</p>@:theScarletKeys.rusesAndReclamation.continue </div>",
    "thorne": "<div class='red bordered'><p>_If Thorne stole the Key(s)_:  If there’s one thing you know about Thorne, it’s that they won’t pass on an opportunity to make a deal. Rather than sneak in, you knock on the front door of their sanctum and are admitted by several smooth, attractive attendants. Thorne sits at the head of a long table, hands steepled. “What a delight! I had no idea you were coming,” they smile brightly, then gesture for you to sit. Drinks and a lavish meal are served, and eventually you steer the conversation toward returning what they stole. “Ah yes. ‘Keys.’ It’s always about ‘Keys,’ isn’t it?” They pour another glass of wine. “Things have changed. I suppose I could be amenable to such an exchange. But only if you make it worth my while.” It takes nearly an hour to come up with compensation enough for Thorne to change their mind, but eventually you leave their sanctum with your stolen relic…and a bit poorer, besides.</p>@:theScarletKeys.rusesAndReclamation.continue </div>",
    "desiderioDelgadoAlvarez": "<div class='red bordered'><p>_If Desiderio Delgado Álvarez stole the Key(s)_: You sneak into Desi’s safehouse and are stunned to find that it is no vault or Coterie hideout, but a fully stocked bar with patrons in boisterous revelry. A bouncer in a pinstripe suit stops you as you enter, but before you can protest or fight back, you hear Desi’s voice call out: “Hey. It’s fine. Let ‘em in.” The bouncer relents, and you sit at a booth across from your adversary. “Guessing I know what this is about. Tell you what: I’m in a good mood. Have a drink or two and I’ll play you for it,” he says, shuffling a deck of cards. Seeing your expression, he grins. “Oh, lighten up. I’m not like those others. One hand. Then we call it even and go our separate ways.” Considering the circumstances, you decide it best to play along—literally. As luck would have it, three jacks is more than enough to beat Desi’s pair. You end up leaving shortly after with your Key reclaimed and no worse for the wear, wondering how much of a sore loser Desi and his crew might be.</p>@:theScarletKeys.rusesAndReclamation.continue </div>",

Stealth is by far the better option. You sneak into a large industrial complex after dark and locate what she stole behind a locked door. As you pick the locks, you hear a lilting voice echo off of the narrow corridors. A haunting song in Shanghainese fills the empty factory. Working quickly, you reclaim the stolen artifact and retrace your steps to the exit, looking over your shoulder at every turn. The song lingers in your memory long after you make your escape.</p>@:theScarletKeys.rusesAndReclamation.continue </div>",

Several days before your arrival at Lake Victoria, another member of my organization appeared at our camp, very interested in the key we had recovered. The one with the red gloves.” The professor stops, looking out at the rolling tide. “It bears explanation, I suppose. My survey of Lake Victoria turned up a number of alarming reports. The lakebed is covered in the ruins of a prehistoric city. We registered an alarming amount of carbon dioxide and strange changes in the local flora and fauna around the lake. At its source, we found a machine of alien design. Its purpose and facility are still a mystery, but whatever it was: it was running. Still is.”</p><p>Masai wipes his red spectacles with a handkerchief. “All that to say: several days before you arrived, I found that man sitting in front of the machine, hat off, staring at it. He was humming—well, that’s not quite right—he was communing with it.”</p><p>A shaft of cloud splits the sunlight overhead, casting the beach in dappled shadows. Masai’s voice breaks the silence. “In truth, I did not care to understand why. Why that man does anything has always been a mystery to me. But there was something other about his demeanor. Something altogether wrong.” Masai breathes deeply as the cloud passes, and warm sunlight overtakes the beach. “So imagine my suspicion when even more as yet unknown Foundation operatives showed up at my survey to interrupt my great work.”</p><p>You ask Masai about this “great work.” He leads you to turn around and begin walking back to his bungalow.</p><p>“It is the work of every person. What is it to be human except to live and help others in this great and perilous world? It’s harder than you might think.” He breathes deep. “If I can leave the world a bit better than I entered it, my work will be done. That is all.
