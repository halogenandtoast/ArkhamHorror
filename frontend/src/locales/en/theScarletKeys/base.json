P. Lovecraft for Hazel Heald, “Out of the Aeons”</p><h3>Around the World</h3><p class='basic'>The Scarlet Keys expansion differs from its predecessors in that it features an open-ended, non-linear campaign. Following the “Riddles and Rain” prologue, investigators are provided with a map of the world, and from there they may choose to embark to various locations. The order in which the locations are chosen determines the order in which these scenarios are played, and may also alter the story and gameplay of each scenario before culminating in an epic finale. Choose wisely, and good luck!</p>"
