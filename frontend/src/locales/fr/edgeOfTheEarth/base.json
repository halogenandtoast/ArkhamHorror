    "body": "<div class='iceAndDeath'><p><b>Prologue 1:</b> “You understand now, yes? Why this expedition must be stopped?” Professor William Dyer sits across from you at his office desk. A wealth of academic papers and scientific journals lies sprawled between you, including Dyer’s own lengthy account of his journey to the Antarctic. Up until the publication of this revised report—the alleged “truth”—the university’s last expedition to Antarctica yielded very little in the way of scientific discoveries.</p><p>At Dyer’s request, you’d read through this new report of what really happened beyond those “Mountains of Madness,” as he had dubbed them. You scarcely would have believed any of it were it not for the bevy of photographs and drawings that came along with it: evidence of mangled, dissected bodies; of perplexing five-pointed snow graves; of strange specimens found half-buried in the ice; and, finally, aerial shots of the jagged black peaks described in Dyer’s tale.</p><p>Dyer has called on you to help convince his colleagues to abandon their planned follow-up expedition. His student, Danforth—the only other member of the expedition to reach the alien stone-city described in Dyer’s report—paces back and forth by the entrance to Dyer’s office, muttering nonsensically to himself while you consider their strange tale.</p><p>You’re still unsure what to make of all this. On the one hand, Dyer’s concern seems genuine, and his account is filled with such detail and specificity that you find it difficult to doubt its authenticity. And yet, there’s no way it could all be true. An ancient city in the ice, built by primordial beings? So-called “Elder Things”? How could such things be real? Danforth mumbles something about a nameless black pit as you place Dyer’s report back on his desk. The professor gazes at you with sleepless, bloodshot eyes. “Well?” Dyer asks. “Will you help us stop this madness? Will you make them see reason?”</p><ul><li>“I believe you…but if what you say is true, should we not investigate these findings further?” Proceed to _Prologue 2_.</li><li>“I’m sorry, but this seems too wild to be true.” Skip to _Prologue 3_.</li></ul></div>"

    "body": "<div class='iceAndDeath'><p><b>Prologue 2:</b> Dyer lets out an anxious breath and relents. “I suppose I might have said the same thing, once. But now, after what I’ve seen…” A shudder courses through the man’s aging body. “You are venturing somewhere humanity does not belong. I am starting to believe that scholars such as ourselves can only continue to probe the depths of science for so long before we are laid low by what we find.”</p><p>“Or by what finds us,” Danforth chimes from behind.</p><p>Dyer glances at his student, studying his expression, then turns his attention back to you. “If you go on this journey with Dr. Kensler, the lot of you may not ever return. Will you not reconsider?”</p><p>You explain that while there is surely significant danger in your expedition, Dr. Amy Kensler—the scientist leading this new trek to Antarctica—has taken precautions to ensure it does not meet the same end as Dyer’s. More importantly, it is the only way to understand the threats they encountered, and the only way to prepare if such threats are unearthed by other, less cautious scientists.</p><p>“Yes, I… I confess I had that same worry,” he replies. “We are unlikely to convince the greater scientific community, I’m afraid. Perhaps it would be better to… to return, and learn more about what we saw…”</p><p>Danforth nods. “I agree. How do we know what we saw is anything more than the overactive imaginings of two explorers with a queer fascination for the bizarre and macabre? Of Arthur Gordon Pym’s ill-fated journeys?”</p><p>Dyer’s eyes narrow at his student. The knowledge reflected in his dark eyes chills you to your core. “You say such things, and yet, I daresay you did not see what I saw.”</p><p>The student scoffs. “You are not the one who glimpsed that mirage at the edge of the mountainside—”</p><p>“I am not referring to the ‘mirage,’ Danforth; I am referring to what I saw in you,” Dyer retorts. “The things you said on that aeroplane, the look on your face…I’ll never forget.” Silence pervades the room as Danforth returns to his corner to languish in his own doubt.</p><p>Dyer pleads with you. “Whatever the case may be, is there nothing I can say to deter you?” You ponder for a brief moment, then shake your head. There is too much at stake—especially if Dyer’s account turns out to be the truth.</p><p>“All right, then,” Dyer concludes with a sigh. “Since you lot have no clue what you are getting into, I suppose we have no choice but to come, too. You can tell Dr. Kensler that she wins. We will be ready to leave within the week.”</p><p>You shake his hand and make for the door. “I hope, for all our sakes, that Danforth is right,” he adds before you are out of earshot.</p><p class='right basic'>In your Campaign Log, record <i>the investigators convinced Dyer to allow the expedition</i>.</p><p class='basic right'>Add 1 {'{'}cultist{'}'} token to the chaos bag for the remainder of the campaign.</p><p class='basic right'>Skip to _Prologue 4_.</div>"

Perhaps my faith in the scientific community was misplaced. Of course Dr. Kensler would not believe me, not even with all this evidence.” He shoves several of the photographs on his desk aside in frustration.</p><p>You explain that Dr. Amy Kensler—the scientist leading this new trek to Antarctica—is motivated by genuine academic curiosity, rather than greed or glory.</p><p>“It matters not,” Dyer remarks bitterly. “Even so, she seeks more evidence of my findings, despite my warnings. And so the cycle continues. Perhaps science itself is naught but folly. We are but silly little mice under glass, seeking escape for our own sake, with little understanding of what lies beyond our cage.”</p><p>Danforth approaches, eyes fixed on the photographs scattered across Dyer’s desk. “Perhaps what we saw is nothing more than the overactive imaginings of two explorers with a queer fascination for the bizarre and macabre.

  "amyKensler": "<p>Standing in front of the plankway leading up to the deck of the Theodosia is Dr. Amy Kensler. A professor of Biology at Miskatonic University, the no-nonsense scientist has been a fixture of the university’s Sciences department for over a decade. Without so much as peering up from her clipboard, she crosses of your name as you approach. “Good of you to make it on time. Mr. Ellsworth here will take your luggage aboard.</p>",
  "roaldEllsworth": "<p>“Oh, I will, will I?” the man standing next to her replies with a chuckle. He offers you his hand in introduction, and you shake it. “Roald Ellsworth, at your service.”</p><p>By way of introduction, Dr. Kensler explains, “Mr. Ellsworth has been on over a dozen expeditions and comes highly recommended. I’m sure his expertise will be invaluable in the weeks to come.”</p><p>Ellsworth rolls his eyes. “His expertise, yes…and his willingness to be used as manual labor!” he adds with a chuckle as he hefts your luggage and takes it up the plankway.</p><p>“Come on, Ellsworth!” shouts another voice from inside the ship. A gruff- looking man with a thick brown beard emerges, motioning for Ellsworth to hurry. “We got a ton ‘o work to get done before we embark!”</p><p>“A little busy, Cookie,” Ellsworth shouts back in reply. Then he turns back to you and remarks over his shoulder: “Do not mind him. Cookie is a bit of an intense fellow, but he is all right.”</p>",
  "jamesFredericks": "<p>“The name’s Fredericks,” the gruff man barks back. “James Fredericks. I swear, sometimes I think I’m the only one here who’s ready for this damned trip,” he mutters angrily. “An’ didn’t anyone ever tell yeh it’s bad luck to name a ship after someone who died at sea?”</p><p>Another voice calls down from the deck of the ship: “Cookie, if you could be so kind as to lower your voice, some of us are trying to work up here.” The man responds with a grunt and ducks back inside the ship, rolling his eyes. You crane your head upwards and see a young woman leaning over the railing of the ship’s deck, her long brown hair tied in a thick ponytail that dangles around her neck. “Hey! You made it,” she calls out to you. “Dr. Kensler was pretty excited that you’re coming along. Looking forward to working with you.”</p>",
  "takadaHiroko": "<p>Without looking up from her clipboard, Dr. Kensler mumbles. “Ms. Takada Hiroko is our aeroplane mechanic. As with the previous expedition, we will be constructing our planes onsite. No need to worry—she may be one of the youngest in her field, but she knows what she is doing.”</p>",
  "averyClaypool": "<p>More of the crew begin to arrive, one by one. The first is a man in his 30s with a wispy blonde beard and bright green eyes. “Mr. Avery Claypool,” Dr. Kensler introduces you to the man, and the two of you shake hands. “Mr. Claypool is an…associate…of Mr. Ellsworth’s. He will be serving as our guide in the Antarctic.”</p><p>“Weather permitting,” Claypool jokes. “Honestly, we will be lucky if we can even get off the ice shelf.”</p><p>“I am confident with your skills we will make it as far as Dyer and Lake did.”</p><p>“That is what I am afraid of,” Claypool mutters, walking briskly past Kensler and up the plankway. On his way up, he passes Ellsworth, and the two freeze, locking eyes. You could swear that the temperature lowers several degrees as the two brush by one another without a single word.</p><p>“They are usually on…better terms,” Dr. Kensler says under her breath, “but recently fell into some issue or another. They had better learn to live with their differences. They will be unable to avoid one another for quite some time, after all.” You watch as Claypool’s gaze wanders back to Ellsworth for just a fraction of a second before he turns away angrily and enters the ship.</p><p>The next to arrive is a woman with warm brown skin and weary eyes. Along with her luggage, she carries a rather large, bright-red medical kit emblazoned with a white cross. She extends her hand, and you cannot help but notice the nervous tremble in Dr. Kensler’s hand as she shakes it. “Thank you for joining us on this voyage, Mala.”</p><p>“Oh, Amy. Somebody has to keep you alive,” she replies. There is a moment of awkward silence as Dr. Kensler glances up at the woman, then down at her feet, her cheeks tinged red. “Right. Well, then,” she remarks, and continues up the walkway.</p>",
  "malaSinha": "<p>Dr. Kensler clears her throat once she is out of earshot. “Dr. Mala Sinha is our physician,” she explains. “It took some convincing to get her to join us, so try not to abuse her expertise with inconsequential problems. Frostbite will be a very real concern, as will gangrene and hypothermia. Try to stay on her good side.” You’re unsure if Dr. Kensler is joking.</p><p>A man’s voice pierces the sudden silence, along with the clamor of a dog barking. “Anyu! Dammit, Anyu, don’t run off like that!” he shouts.</p><p>“That will be Mr. Ashevak,” Dr. Kensler says, scratching off another name from her list. Moments later, you watch as a large gray-furred dog bounds toward you, its tongue hanging out of its mouth in excitement. You lean over and pet the dog, running your hand along her thick, long fur. The man finally catches up to the dog, huffing with effort. “Anyu… Come on, I thought I… trained you better than this,” he says, catching his breath.</p>",
  "eliyahAshevak": "<p>“Eliyah Ashevak is our dog handler,” Dr. Kensler interjects, “He is in charge of taking care of the 44 sledge dogs we are bringing along with us, not to mention their feeding and training.</p><p>“Anyu here makes 45,” he corrects her before turning to shake your hand. “Also, we’ll be holed up in this ship for a while, so let’s drop the formalities. Just ‘Eliyah’ is fine.”</p>",
  "williamDyer": "<p>As the man and his enormous dog board the ship, you ask Dr. Kensler if she received the letter you sent regarding Professor Dyer’s concerns. “I am well aware of his report,” Dr. Kensler replies, “but as I have told him time and time again, I have no intention of ceasing or postponing this expedition—” Just then, footsteps approach behind you, interrupting your conversation. “—speak of the devil,” Dr. Kensler mutters, looking up from her clipboard. You turn to find none other than Professor William Dyer and his student Danforth, each toting several bags of luggage. “I’m glad you finally decided to join us, William.”</p><p> “Amy,” he acknowledges. “I am not here because I believe in your mission statement. I am here to make sure you and your companions do not get themselves killed. You have no idea what you are walking into.”</p><p>“Then you will have ample enough opportunity to educate us along the way.” She turns to address young Danforth, who is staring up at the tanker ship with a pained expression. “Danforth, I hope you understand that you are under no obligation to come along on this expedition. After everything you went through…” she trails off, her eyebrows raised in worry atypical of her usual cold demeanor.</p><p>“I appreciate your concern, Dr. Kensler, but I am looking forward to the opportunity to return to Antarctica. I want…need…to be there again.”</p><p>She follows his gaze to the Theodosia, which bobs steadily up and down on the choppy Atlantic waters. “Very well. We are still working to get all of our equipment aboard. Mr. Ellsworth can help you find your rooms.” You nod and begin boarding, along with the remaining crew and the rest of the expedition team—mostly students of the university, along with several unaffiliated explorers and several researchers in a variety of fields. Once more you spy the scant sliver of sunlight above before it is smothered by gray clouds.</p>",

She has been preparing in secret—you can tell from the provisions she keeps from the rest of the party, the aeroplane parts she tinkers with in her spare time. “You are right.” She sighs in response to your allegation. “I was thinking of going back. Breaking off in secret, heading back to the ice shelf, and getting as far away from this damned place as possible. But…” she glances at the rest of the team, their mood hopeful despite the ominous feeling in the air. “I would never make it back on my own. Do not worry. I am not going anywhere. Go ahead, take whatever is in that pack for yourself.” You choose to trust her, though you cannot help but worry. Her usual monotone is full of jaded cynicism, but this is different. She sounds as though she has given up. “Why are you still here?” she asks after a long while. “You have what you came for.” You shake your head and tell her that you are here for her. She chances the hint of a smile. “Well that is awful foolish of you. But…thanks.”</p><p>Takada ensures you are better equipped for the next leg of the journey. Any one investigator may begin _Scenario IV: The Heart of Madness_ with 3 additional resources in their resource pool.</p>",
    "takadaIsCrossedOut": "<p class='basic'>_If Takada Hiroko is crossed out and an investigator did not already earn her Memorial of the Lost card from a previous Interlude:_</p><p>For somebody who supposedly took pride in her organizational skills, Takada’s mechanical supplies are an absolute mess. If you didn’t know any better, you would think there was no rhyme or reason whatsoever to how she stored her things—but with Takada, you suspect that she had a system of some kind. You spend several minutes poring through her belongings in search of anything that might be of value to the remaining members of the expedition. Without Takada, you won’t be able to put the final aeroplane in flying shape. In fact, you imagine you’ll be forced to leave most of her things behind when you make for the mountains tomorrow. Still, you think you can make use of some of the supplies she had tucked away.</p><p class='basic'>Any one investigator may add the Takada’s Cache story event to their deck.

    "ashevakIsAlive": "<p>_If Eliyah Ashevak is alive:_</p><p>It isn’t difficult to find Eliyah. Anyu’s insistent barking makes his location all too obvious. “Stop it, girl!” he orders, struggling to keep her calm. The dog stands at the edge of the camp, barking at the darkness beyond as though there is something lurking at the edge of your sight. Perhaps there is. Something only she can see. “Seriously, Anyu! Stop! You’re making too much noise!” Eliyah shouts. When he sees you approach, he motions for you to help pull her away. “Can you grab her collar? We need to get her back to the tents.” After some struggling, you finally manage to wrench the dog away and lead her back to camp. She whines the entire way, her snout twinging. “She’s got the scent of something,” Eliyah says once she is calm. “Never seen her act this way before. Whatever is up ahead, it cannot possibly be good. Or normal.” He runs his hand through his hair and shrugs. “But what else is new in this damned place?”</p><p class='basic'>Bonding with Eliyah and Anyu makes things just a little better.

You turn in shock, prepared to see another one of those horrid creatures emerging from the ice—but it’s only Anyu, Eliyah’s loyal companion. The big gray dog looks up at you with pleading eyes. You shake your head and rise, heavy, to your feet. That’s enough mourning for one night. As you venture back to camp, soft footfalls trail through the snow just behind you. You stop and glance at Anyu. Once again, she looks up to meet your gaze. Is she looking for comfort, or guidance? You kneel and run your gloved fingers through her thick fur, speaking soothingly to reassure the both of you. Yes, Eliyah is gone. No, I don’t know if we are safe, either. Do you want to stick with me? Anyu wags her tail. All right, then.</p><p class='basic'>Any one investigator may add the Anyu story asset to their deck.

She paces and fidgets and quietly recites sentences until finally, Dr. Sinha arrives. You’d leave her to her privacy, but she requested you stay. “Mala,” she says dryly, despite all of the practice. “I was wondering— that is, I was—I would like to—” she clears her throat and tries again. “Would you like to have dinner again, sometime? And perhaps another show?” she finally manages to say.</p><p>Dr. Sinha rolls her eyes, hiding a smile. “Yes, you idiot.”</p><p>Dr. Kensler blinks in surprise. You get the feeling she has never been called such a thing before.</p><p>“Amy, you are highly astute, incredibly well read, and a true prodigy in your field.

You recognize the book from Dr. Kensler’s possessions, and several of the others from the restricted collection of the Orne Library.</p><p>Danforth closes his eyes. “No, no, no…” He moves to the chalkboard and begins to erase. “It is different. Different, different…” Only then do the two of them spot you in the entrance.

The unlikely duo seem more comfortable with one another than anybody else on the crew. Finally, a lull in the conversation gives you the opportunity to reveal yourself.

You ask the pair what they intend to do when they get back to Arkham.</p><p>“Roko wants to—you tell ‘em,” Cookie says.</p><p>Takada sighs and sits up, wiping sweat from her brow with the back of her gloved hand. “I…I want to try to look for my father. I have asked Mr. Fredericks to join me.” The two of them share a knowing glance. “It is a long shot, I know. He likely crashed into the ocean many years ago. Even so, I want—I need to know. I have his logs. We should be able to find evidence. Something.”</p><p>“An’ if not,” Cookie adds, “still better than sittin’ around, waiting to be sent on another fool’s errand like this one.”</p><p>You nod and excuse yourself.
