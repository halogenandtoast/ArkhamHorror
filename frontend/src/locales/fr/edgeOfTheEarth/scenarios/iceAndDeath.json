      "body": "<p>It has been a long eight weeks since you left Boston, and not without its toil. The Theodosia followed much the same route as its predecessors, the Arkham and the Miskatonic—first sailing southward along the east coast and through the Panama Canal, before venturing toward the Antarctic Circle. As the weather grew steadily colder, icebergs became more and more of a problem for the ship to navigate, but with the crew’s expertise and the logs of the previous captains who made this same journey, you make good time. Soon enough, you spy the mist-covered peaks of Mts. Erebus and Terror ahead, marking the site of Ross Island, near the ice shelf that will serve as the expedition’s landing spot.</p><p>As you approach the coast, Dr. Kensler and the rest of the team meet aboard the deck of the Theodosia to discuss your plans. “We’ll use the same breeches-buoy system as before to unload supplies onto the ice shelf,” she explains. “Mr. Fredericks, Mr. Ellsworth, and Mr. Claypool, you’ll be taking one of our smaller boats to the shelf to find us a landing zone. Ms. Takada, once we have a camp up and running, those aeroplanes are your first priority. Mr. Ashevak, I expect those sledges to help move supplies from the landing to camp. As soon as we reach the ice shelf, there’s going to be a lot of work to get done in a short time. I don’t want you to have to wrangle three dozen dogs on top of all that. So get them in order.”</p><p>Eliyah rolls his eyes and idly pets Anyu, who sits diligently by his side. “Yes ma’am.”</p><p>Professor Dyer speaks up. “I suspect the lack of ice-melting and boring equipment means we aren’t taking any mineral samples?” he asks rhetorically.</p><p>Dr. Kensler shakes her head. “No need, although if we happen to find a suitable piece, we might as well claim it. That said, our mission is solely to corroborate the findings you made with Danforth, and to bring back more evidence of this ancient species, these ‘Elder Things,’ as you dubbed them. A living specimen would be ideal, of course…such a strange and alien beast, trapped in ice throughout the ages—it would be like discovering a live woolly mammoth, I imagine.”</p><p>He balks at that. “A living specimen? You do know these things killed several of Lake’s men, right? And how do you propose we capture one, exactly?”</p><p>She blinks. “You’re the expert, William. You tell me.”</p><p>Dyer walks off, shaking his head and muttering angrily. “I knew this was a bad idea…”</p><p>“All right, you all have your assignments. We will reach land within the hour. Be ready,” Dr. Kensler says, dismissing the meeting. Before she can go below deck, you approach and remark that you aren’t sure what you should be doing just yet.</p><p>“Oh, there will be enough manual labor to go around,” she replies with the hint of a smirk.</p>"

Ms. Takada, along with two other mechanics, have fully assembled three aeroplanes along the flat ice shelf—a perfect place for takeoffs and landings. Your team congregates by the aeroplanes, along with several days’ worth of camping equipment. The plan is to fly two of the planes over the vast, jagged peaks, taking aerial photographs of the stone city mentioned in Dyer’s account…that is, if such a thing really exists.</p><p>“If we can find a safe landing zone, we will set up a temporary outpost,” Dr. Kensler explains. “Dyer, Danforth, Fredericks, and Claypool will stick around while the rest of us head back to base camp. We can use the sledges to ferry supplies to and from the camps. Otherwise, we’ll simply scout out the area and head back to base camp.” The team nods in agreement and begins boarding the planes.</p>"
