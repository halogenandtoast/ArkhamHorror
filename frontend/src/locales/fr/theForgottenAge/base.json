Il disait avoir un travail à me confier, mais je ne savais honnêtement pas à quoi m’attendre.</p><p>Harlan m’a présenté l’un de ses collègues : Alejandro Vela, un historien célèbre de l’autre côté de la frontière sud. M. Vela est diplômé d’une prestigieuse université de Mexico et a passé de nombreuses années à étudier l’Empire aztèque. Il prétend avoir trouvé des preuves de l’existence d’une cité-état aztèque encore inconnue appelée Eztli. Mais ses découvertes aussi étranges qu’inédites n’ont pas été prises au sérieux par l’université et il est devenu un paria auprès de ses pairs.</p><p>Alejandro est venu à Arkham dans le but de rassembler des fonds pour monter une expédition afin d’explorer les forêts tropicales du sud du Mexique où reposent, selon lui, les ruines encore inviolées de l’altepetl d’Eztli. Sa description des origines de la cité-état défie toutes nos connaissances actuelles sur l’histoire de l’Amérique précolombienne. Malgré cela – ou plutôt à cause de cela, connaissant bien mon vieil ami –, Harlan a été fasciné par les découvertes d’Alejandro. L’Université Miskatonic a accepté de financer l’expédition (quoique chichement), et Harlan compte sur moi pour en faire partie.</p><p>Si vous voulez mon avis, il y a de grandes probabilités pour que nous partions à la recherche de quelque chose qui n’existe même pas. Mais s’il y a la moindre chance que ce peuple appelé Eztli ait réellement vécu, les implications historiques seraient alors considérables. Après avoir débattu pendant quelque temps de cette proposition, nous avons finalement accepté l’offre d’Alejandro. Les préparatifs sont en cours et nous devrions décoller d’ici la fin du mois. Avec un peu de chance, nous pourrons remplir ce journal avec toutes sortes d’intéressantes découvertes. Sinon, il fera toujours une bonne cale pour le bureau branlant d’Harlan.</p>",

How he maintains his starry-eyed idealism after the hell we went through in the jungle is beyond me. His attention is fixated on the strange relic that we discovered in the ruins. I wish we knew a little more about the artifact’s origins. It unsettles me greatly. It hums at all times and pulses with an otherworldly energy I can scarcely describe. As we traveled home with the artifact in tow, our nights were plagued by bizarre nightmares: dreams of other worlds and civilizations.</p><p>Alejandro wants to bring the relic to the Miskatonic Museum, to put on display along with the other Eztli artifacts we discovered. My feelings are mixed. At the museum, it will receive proper care, and historians will be able to study it and perhaps even discern its purpose. However, I fear that the relic may be too dangerous for the public. After all, we still have no idea what the damned thing even is. Alejandro would hate it, but perhaps it would be better to keep the relic somewhere safe, where Harlan and I can study it in private.

Alejandro has already written extensively about our discoveries, but his work has only just begun. Many mysteries about our expedition remain. How have the Eztli people remained undiscovered for so long? Why did they appear to be guarding the jungle, and from what? Who really built the temple ruins we explored? I have no doubt Alejandro will uncover the answers to these questions, given enough time.</p><p>As for me, my role in this endeavor has ended. However, I have yet to relax. My thoughts are constantly in the jungle—serpentine figures in the shadows, obsidian arrows embedded in skeletal bodies, malformed voices shrieking in the cavernous depths.

When the University’s latest expedition returned with only a few survivors and a handful of strange, archaic artifacts, he came to you for advice.</p><p>“I know, I know. I should at least take solace in the fact that the expedition was successful, despite its heavy losses. Alejandro was right all along. The Eztli people are real. And yet…I am concerned about some of these findings.” Harlan pulls a small leather-bound journal from his suitcase and hands it to you. “Before the expedition leader’s tragic death, the leader recorded many of the group’s discoveries in this journal. One of the surviving members of the expedition managed to grab it from the camp before fleeing the jungle. I think if you read these entries, you’ll understand what I mean. The things they experienced, the creatures they encountered…” Harlan shudders and adjusts his glasses with too-shaky hands. “I am concerned not only for Alejandro, but for all of us.
