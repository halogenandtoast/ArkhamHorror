    "body": "<p class='anke'>Sunday, June 28th, 1925</p><p>It’s been a hell of a day. We’ve just set up camp along the northern border of the rainforest where Alejandro believes the Eztli once dwelled. The jungle here is dense and untamed. The sky hides above the tree cover, but I can tell from the crisp breeze that storm clouds are brewing overhead.</p><p>The dangers of our expedition have been explained to us many times. We are hundreds of miles away from any sign of civilization. Nobody in modern times has yet to pierce the heart of these wilds. Until now, nobody has had reason to try. After all, it wouldn’t make sense to find Aztec ruins in this region of Mexico. And yet, here we are: looking for ruins that may not exist in a place where, by all accounts, they should not.</p><p>Already one of our surveyors has fallen ill, and another has been bitten by a viper. I’m starting to think the rainforest doesn’t want us here. If this luck persists, ours will be the shortest expedition in Miskatonic University’s history. Tonight, we rest. Tomorrow, we venture into uncharted wilds.</p>"
