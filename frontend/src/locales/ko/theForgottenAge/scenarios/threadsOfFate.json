    "intro1": "<p>_도입부 1_: The night passes with Ichtaca resting in your living room. You get no sleep for the remainder of the night, your thoughts drifting between concern and disbelief. Her story is preposterous, but you feel compelled to believe it nonetheless. You’ve known that the relic from the Eztli ruins had some deeper purpose ever since you first laid eyes on it. When you emerge from your bedroom the next morning, your uninvited guest is sitting at your dining-room table, arms crossed tightly across her chest. Her piercing eyes trace your every move like a bird watching its prey. No pleasantries are exchanged. “Where is the relic now?” Ichtaca asks impatiently. “Where have you brought it?” You explain that it is safe, in good hands. She shakes her head, her knuckles white with frustration. “I assure you it is not.”</p><p class='basic right'>캠페인 기록지를 확인합니다. *If the investigators gave custody of the relic to Alejandro*, or *if Alejandro recovered the Relic of Ages*: Proceed to _도입부 2_.</p><p class='basic right'>*If the investigators gave custody of the relic to Harlan Earnstone*: Skip to _도입부 3_.</p>",
    "intro2": "<p>_도입부 2_: Setting aside your many questions for the time being, you call your contact at the Miskatonic University Museum. Despite the early hour, Dr. Horowitz should be at her office preparing for the long day ahead of her. The operator connects you after a short delay. Elli gives you an unusually curt greeting, her voice cracking and unsteady. As soon as you ask about the relic, she scoffs. “Not you, too! Mr. Walsted is practically knocking down my office door, and two reporters have been harrassing me all morning!”</p><p>You ask her what the trouble is, and she lets out a long sigh. “The relic is missing,” she explains. “None of the security guards knows what happened. One minute it was in its display case; the next it was gone. And before you ask, no, Mr. Vela is nowhere to be found.” Suddenly she is yelling to another party, “One moment please! I am on the telephone!” She apologizes to you tersely and hangs up a moment later.</p><p>Sure enough, Alejandro is not answering his telephone, and none of his other associates have seen him since yesterday. “Believe me now?” Ichtaca asks, rising to her feet and gathering her things. “We’ve wasted enough time. Find the relic and meet me back here tonight. Don’t follow me.”</p><ul><li>The lead investigator must decide (choose one):<ul><li>“You’re not going anywhere until you tell me what is going on.” Skip to _도입부 4_.</li><li>“Have it your way.” Skip to _도입부 5_.</li></ul></li></ul>",
    "intro3": "<p>_도입부 3_: Setting aside your many questions for the time being, you call Harlan’s office at the university. Though the sun is barely peeking over the horizon, you’ve always known him to be an early riser. The operator connects you after a short delay. Harlan’s voice is shaky and rough. He cuts you off as soon as you ask about the relic. “Don’t!” he barks. “They’re listening. They know I am keeping it here. They have already taken Alejandro.” You try to calm him down so you can ask him what he means, but he cuts the conversation short. “I have to go. They are here!—” The line goes dead.</p><p>Sure enough, Alejandro is not answering his telephone, and none of his other associates have seen him since yesterday. “Believe me now?” Ichtaca asks, rising to her feet and gathering her things. “We’ve wasted enough time.

    "intro4": "<p>_도입부 4_: Ichtaca grits her teeth and pauses. You expect her to refuse and leave without answering your questions, but surprisingly, she relents. According to Ichtaca, her people have spent ages protecting the relic from interlopers who would use it for nefarious purposes. She speaks cryptically, in half-riddles and tall tales, although she refuses to explain where her people come from and how they have remained hidden for so long. When pressed about the relic, all she says is that it controls the flow of time, and that it must not be tampered with.</p><p>“It must return to its rightful place,” she explains. Her gaze is relentless, unwavering. “Do you understand? It cannot fall into the wrong hands. If you help me recover it, I will aid you in return. Just promise me you will not use it.”</p><ul><li>Remember that “you listened to Ichtaca’s tale.”</li><li>Add 1 {'{'}cultist{'}'} token to the chaos bag for the remainder of the campaign.</li><li>Skip to _게임 준비_.</li></ul>",
