    },
    "title": "Prologue",
    "body": "<p>You turn over the folded program in your hand, reading it for what seems like the hundredth time. “Miskatonic Playhouse presents: The King in Yellow,” it reads. “A special one-night engagement at Arkham’s very own Ward Theatre. An irresistible drama in two acts. Production staged and directed by Nigel Engram.” The cast is a small ensemble, with one unattributed credit at the end: “The Stranger.”</p><p>To have such a highly anticipated play come to Arkham all the way from Paris is a noteworthy event, even if it is just for one night. For weeks leading up to the show, it was the talk of the town. It seemed so unassuming…and yet, you have evidence something sinister is at work. It started with the disappearance of one of the stagehands at the theatre—a boy of only seventeen who missed rehearsal one night and was never seen again. Then, less than two weeks before the performance, there was the musician whose corpse was found with a gun in its mouth. Perhaps most chilling was the crazed man the coppers had picked up in Independence Square who had been ranting and raving about the “King’s return.” He was brought to Arkham Asylum, and you were surprised to discover that he was not alone in his delusions.</p><p>Finding these events suspicious, you and your companions have delved deeper into the matter. Although no connection can be proven, these weren’t the only strange events surrounding the up-and-coming play. Instances of suicide and madness have followed in its wake, and you are determined to discover why.</p><p>The lights in the auditorium dim, and a spotlight shines on the stage. What unfolds is not quite what you expected. Slow‑paced and monotonous, the first act of The King in Yellow is a tedious bore. The setting and characters are compelling, but the meandering and nonsensical story does little to entertain or inform. You begin to wonder whether the dreadful events surrounding The King in Yellow aren’t connected, after all. Perhaps it was just your overactive imagination; how could such a trivial and unassuming show cause such pandemonium? You are surprised when the first act closes without any rising action or revelation. The lights rise for the intermission, and you consider leaving early, stifling a yawn. Before you are able to decide, however, you find yourself drifting…drifting…to sleep.</p>",

    "lola": "<p>_Lola Prologue_: Act I came and went without a hitch, as it often did in rehearsal. You couldn’t help but note the blank, dismissive expressions on many of the audience members’ faces, and you wonder how the audience will react to the play’s disturbing second half. The role of Cassilda is tiresomely boring for the first half of the play, although you enjoy portraying her regal charm. You find yourself missing your previous co-star, Miriam Twain, and suddenly the dread and regret you had felt in Paris comes flooding back. With a sigh, you retreat to a dark corner backstage to escape the sounds of stagehands preparing for the next scene. You try to quell your emotions and replace your thoughts with those of Cassilda’s­ —her hopes, her fears, her fate.</p><p>Just then, you catch the Stranger staring at you from afar, and you find yourself shaking at the mere sight of him. Even though they continue to replace the actor who plays the Stranger before each show (and indeed many times during rehearsals), you know that this last-minute replacement is the most horrid of them all. Realizing you never caught his name, a shiver of terror courses through your spine. Have you found your way back to the wolves, like a lost lamb? You cannot look away— his gaze is inescapable. Everything goes black.</p>",

What if the hauntings that follow The King in Yellow are but transitory? The answers to all of your questions might lie inside. Cautiously, you open the front door to the manor once again. Reassuring jazz and the clamor of casual conversation grow louder as you step inside. The enticing smell of roasted pork wafts through the air. As you suspected, the signs of struggle and oddities you noticed before have vanished without explanation. Then, as you turn the corner into the dining room, you find the Stranger speaking with another man—tall, mustached, wearing a fine black suit, and holding a silver-handled cane. The Stranger turns to you, his gaze drills through your mind, and your vision swims with agony. Before you realize it, you are running as fast as you can, toppling through the front doorway in a haze of pain and disorientation.

You hope it’s enough, but you aren’t willing to stick around to find out.

Knowing what you must do, you first siphon some gas from Mrs. Dumaine’s Oakland 6-54A. You spread the gasoline across the front porch, inside the garage, and around the manor’s outer walls. From there, all it takes is several matches to start the blaze. You watch from the front yard as the manor is eventually consumed by the flames. The sounds of crackling fire and snapping wood and the screeching of dying horrors fills the street. Satisfied, you head back to your vehicle and tear off toward Southside, full of grim determination.</p><ul><li>You did what had to be done… Right?</li><li>캠페인 기록지에 *you slayed the monsters at the dinner party*라고 기록합니다.

Daniel is a loose cannon, dazed and unresponsive one moment, and screaming for his life the next. It takes several days for him to realize he’s no longer institutionalized, which for some reason makes him even more terrified. “He’s coming for me, he’s coming for me!” he rambles, sometimes for hours at a time. Finally, during an unusually warm and starry night, Daniel is calm enough to open up to you. “The King in Yellow, it’s not just a play,” he explains. “It’s a being named Hastur, and He’s already claimed me. But there’s still time for you. You are not yet possessed. You have yet to speak the Oath. Whatever you do, speak not his name. Do not give in.” You ask him about the strange events that have been happening across town, and of the cultists and creatures you’ve encountered. “They are trying to find Carcosa,” he says matter-of-factly. You recognize the name as the fictional city from the play, the one The King in Yellow rules over. “They want to release Hastur from His prison. But you!­ —You can open the way to Carcosa before they do! You can seal Hastur for good!” He grips you tightly as he rants. “Quickly, before the Stranger discovers our plan!”</p><p>Hours later, Daniel is incoherent and unresponsive once more.

You are surprised to find the body of Daniel Chesterfield instead, lying on the ground with a pained, wide-eyed expression on his face. He is dead. His eyes are bloodshot and yellow, and he clutches a copy of The King in Yellow in his stiff hands. You pry the playbook from his deathly grasp and examine it. Daniel has scribbled notes in the margins of each page, mostly incomprehensible, but with a few lucid standouts. The first time the fictional city of Carcosa is mentioned, scrawled next to it Daniel has written:</p><div class='wolgast'><p>*Carcosa is real</p><p>Do not let them open the path</p></div><p>When Cassilda speaks of the tattered king, Daniel has written:</p><div class='wolgast'><p>Hastur is the king in tatters</p><p>locked in his prison in the stars</p><p>seal him away and stop this madness</p></div><p>Your mind swims with questions.
