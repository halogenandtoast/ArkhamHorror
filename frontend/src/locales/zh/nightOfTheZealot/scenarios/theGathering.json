Over the past few weeks, several townspeople have mysteriously gone missing. Recently, their corpses turned up in the woods, savaged and half - eaten.

See what you have done?” She pushes a chair in front of the door, lodging it beneath the doorknob. “We must get out of here. Come with me, and I will tell you what I know. We are the only ones who can stop the threat that lurks beneath from being unleashed throughout the city.” You’re in no state to argue. Nodding, you follow the woman as she runs from your front porch out into the rainy street, toward Rivertown.</p>",

The fire spreads quickly, and you run out the front door to avoid being caught in the inferno. From the sidewalk, you watch as everything you own is consumed by the flames. “Come with me,” the woman says. “You must be told of the threat that lurks below. Alone, we are surely doomed…but together, we can stop it.”</p>"

You are making a grave mistake!” she warns. “You do not understand the threat that lurks below…the grave danger we are all in!” Still shaken by the night’s events, you decide to hear the woman out. Perhaps she can shed some light on these bizarre events…but she doesn’t seem to trust you very much.</p>"
