    "body": "<p><b>Intro 1:</b> To stop the merging between the land of dreams and the waking world, you decide to force your way into the “Dreamlands”—as your new companion Randolph calls the dimension—in your physical body, instead of traveling there in your sleep. “While there are many dangers to this method of travel, I think it is better than the alternative,” Randolph claims. “If we venture there in our sleep, we may become trapped like your companions, unable to wake.” You agree: you can do little good trapped on the other side, especially if you aim to help your dreaming companions.</p><p>“Our first step is to find a key. Even in places where the Dreamlands borders the waking world, one cannot simply walk between them. I once possessed a key to the Gate of Dreams, but I lost it years ago and have been unable to find it since,” he laments.</p>"

    "body": "<p><b>Intro 2:</b> The black cat, perched on a nearby park bench, glares at Randolph with narrow, disdainful eyes. “You lost the key to the Dreamlands?”</p><p>You share in the cat’s skepticism. Randolph sighs and shakes his head. “Let me explain,” he says to you. “It is not a physical key. It never was. The ‘key’ was the sense of wonder, fantasy, and creativity that sparked my imagination when I was young. These are things we do not value in maturity. It is only natural the key to these kinds of dreams should be lost with age.”</p><p>“What foolishness!” the black cat scolds. “It is not ‘maturity’ to leave one’s imagination behind. You have abandoned the best part of you. You are more a mewling kitten now than any child I have ever met.”</p><p>“Perhaps you are right,” Randolph agrees, downcast. “I forced myself to believe that earthly concerns were more important than juvenile fantasies of gilded spires, perfumed jungles, and twilight realms...and now I fear I shall never see such wonders again.” He turns back toward you, his eyes full of regret. “And worse, I will be unable to guide you.”</p>"

    "body": "<p><b>Intro 4:</b> You ask what might have turned Randolph’s mind away from the fantastical and toward more practical concerns. He thinks for a brief time, mulling over the possibilities. Then, his eyes go wide as he realizes something important. “There was an incident many years ago. It was the last time I was involved with something supernatural—that is, before today,” he explains. “I met a friend of mine—Joel Manton— in the graveyard next to the old abandoned house in the Merchant District. The one they call the Unnamable. I didn’t want to believe that it was truly haunted, as the stories told, but in merely repeating the legend, I drew the creature’s ire.”<p><p>You ask of the creature, and Randolph closes his eyes as a violent shudder courses up his spine. “It cannot be described. All I know is that we barely survived. It was my fault Joel was hurt. From that day forth, I have had no desire to delve into the supernatural or the superstitious. Not because I did not believe, but because I was frightened. Is that why the key eludes me? Is that why I can no longer dream?” The realization hits him, clear as day. “I know where we have to go. That is where I lost the key. That must be where it can be regained!” he exclaims, wide-eyed.</p><p>As Randolph frantically tries to hail a taxicab, you realize where he means to go: to the house without a name, where the indescribable creature that still haunts his memory resides...</p>"

No, far from it: this cold, bleak gulf eats away your hope and replaces it with a feeling of empty, meaningless dread. You ask Randolph if this is the way to your comatose companions. You almost hope that you are traveling in the wrong direction, so you can leave this awful place behind.</p><p>“I do not know,” he replies, peering out one of the windows along the stairway. “We have traveled beyond the waking world, but this is the lower plane of the Dreamlands, known as the Underworld. It is an inhospitable place. Many of the creatures we have seen crossing over into our world come from this region. Perhaps our key knew this was our true destination?” Your guide examines the arcane key you found in the abandoned house, running his fingers over its arabesques as though recalling its shape, its weight, its texture. His eyes water with the depth of his loss.</p><p>You offer to hold the key for him, which yanks him from his private thoughts. “Ah. Yes, perhaps that would be best,” he says, handing the delicate artifact to you. It is surprisingly heavy for something that, according to Randolph, is not real.</p><p>With Randolph and the Silver Key in tow, you continue your descent anew. The Underworld may or may not be where your companions are, but if the creatures invading the world of the waking are indeed from this place, then perhaps here you can find answers.</p>"

The wind is pulled out of your lungs. You cannot scream. You grasp desperately at the ground as the creature tears at your skin and tramples your bones. Somehow you wrench yourself free, escaping through the vortex of bitter, withering wind surrounding the creature. You hear the scrape of peeling plaster. Debris whips past your head. A loose brick hits your shoulder. You wonder if there will even be a building left to tremble at when this is all over.</p>"

Despite all odds, you somehow reach him, the indescribable monstrosity hot on your heels. Randolph wrenches open your hand, grabs the key you found in the unnamed house, and clutches it tightly. He closes his eyes and whispers something inaudible. As the abominable torrent crashes into you, everything goes black.</p><p>When you awaken, you lie on a flat stone platform overlooking a steep, straight staircase that descends into unknown depths. Behind you, the stairway curls upward into a stone spire that ascends into a hazy mist. In both directions, the entirety of the cavern is dimly lit with grey phosphorescence. Randolph pulls you to your feet. “That was a close one,” he admits. “I never wish to take a journey like that again.” You ask where you are, and he bites his lip, looking out over the bleak, desolate scenery.</p><p>“This is the lower plane of the Dreamlands, known as the Underworld. It is an inhospitable place. Many of the creatures we have seen crossing over into our world come from this region. Perhaps our key knew this was our true destination. I think...I think it is gone now,” your guide explains.</p><p>You are thunderstruck. Randolph grits his teeth at your reaction and looks away in shame. “Forget it. We no longer need it anyway. Let’s go.” His curt reply echoes off the stone steps. With Randolph leading the way, you continue your descent anew.

You barely hear Randolph shouting as the indescribable monstrosity crashes into him. Despite all odds, you somehow reach the rubble that was once the attic of the house with no name. You realize now what that elusive glimmer was: the polished reflection of a bright silver key. “Use it!” Randolph screams between cries of agony. The abomination climbs atop his body. “Use it now, while you ca—”</p><p>The thing cuts Randolph’s cry short as it envelops his body. You clutch the key tightly in your hand and shudder as you watch a thousand shapes of horror devour Randolph whole. You think of your companions, trapped somewhere in a perilous dream far from home, and the key’s glow intensifies, swallowing you as completely as the creature swallowed Randolph. Everything goes white.</p><p>When you awaken, you lie on a flat stone platform overlooking a steep, straight staircase that descends into unknown depths.

No, far from it: this cold, bleak gulf eats away your hope and replaces it with a feeling of empty, meaningless dread. You peer once more up the countless steps behind you. It seems you have no choice now but to move on, deeper into this desolate and perilous realm.</p>"
