One of the winged creatures points in the direction of the foreboding ruin, silently commanding you to proceed.

    "body": "<p>The White Ship sails effortlessly through the aether. Along the way, it passes under archways of woven shadow, over cerulean seas that glimmer in the moonlight, and through vast swaths of dense mist. Eventually, you reach a continent far to the north, where even your intrepid captain never ventured. Colossal creatures dwell in the deep, dark ocean—a terrible danger to any ship that dares the dreadful seas. The captain moors the flying ship over a desolate landscape of ice and snow. Several moonbeams emerge from the ship’s white hull, forming a gangway to the tundra below. In the distance, through a haze of snowflakes, you can barely make out the shape of a domed building. “Welcome to the accursed Plateau of Leng,” the elderly captain says with a hint of regret in his voice. “You will find no joy or peace here. Only death. Please, I must implore you once more to forsake this quest and return to fairer lands. Are you sure this is where you would like to disembark?”</p><p>You nod. The captain sighs in reply. “I see. The White Ship shall sail no more to this forsaken place, for it shakes me to my core. You are on your own from here. I bid you farewell and good luck, fellow traveler.” You cross over bright, vivid moonbeams down onto the bleak expanse below. You will find and scale the peaks of unknown Kadath, or you will die trying.</p>"

  "grandDesign1": "<p><b>Grand Design 1:</b> Higher and higher, you scale the mountains far to the north. Pale light shines from atop a great black peak piercing the vibrant firmament, and you know that you approach the end of your quest. You spend untold hours ascending the snow-covered slopes until finally you reach the forbidden steps leading to the castle’s great hall. The castle stands astride a precipice that overlooks the entire continent and the ocean beyond. It is a majestic sight. Above, countless tenebrous towers loom, swathed in a vortex of snow and hail. You break a trail through the crusted snow before the castle, and it soon gives way to smooth, polished onyx. The biting wind quiets to a whistle. You are bathed in a prodigious darkness that fills the vast space. Soon there is nothing but the echoing of your footsteps on the onyx floor and the quiet, lonely stillness of the great hall. Though you have crossed no doorway, you realize now where you stand: inside the halls of the Great Ones. You expected to be met by guards, servants of the gods, or perhaps even those powerful beings themselves, but you are met only by loneliness and foreboding as chilling as the piercing winds outside. You continue forward until at last you reach the end of the hall. Here, flanked by smooth onyx pillars, you find...nothing.</p><p>There are no gods here. This place is long abandoned.</p><p>Virgil is agape. “I...I don’t understand.”</p>",
  "grandDesign2": "<p><b>Grand Design 2:</b> You turn to Randolph for answers. He has been your guide through all of this madness. Surely he will know what is going on. “Finally,” he says, gazing upon the hall with wide eyes. “We have reached the halls of the Great Ones, upon whom it is unlawful for mortals to look. We knew it was forbidden, yet here we are, our quest complete.” He turns to Virgil. “Was it worth it, sir? Have you found the evidence you seek?”</p><p>Virgil takes a step back. “What are you on about, Randolph? Was this not your idea? You are the one who led us on this quest to begin with.”</p><p>Randolph smiles and places a hand on Virgil’s shoulder. “Yes, I am. But I am not Randolph Carter.” He pulls back his other arm and, before you can react, drives a razor-sharp blade of onyx through Virgil Gray’s chest. Virgil’s corpse slides to the polished floor, eyes forever frozen in tragic shock. The being that was never Randolph Carter turns toward you, its shadow shifting into myriad shapes as it stretches across the ground. “Behold!” its many voices growl. “Your just reward!”</p>",
  "grandDesign3": "<p><b>Grand Design 3:</b> Just then, a voice behind you breaks the silence, punctuating your confusion. “Virgil Gray. You have come to see the Great Ones, upon whom it is unlawful for mortals to look.” The voice belongs to a tall, thin figure bedecked in the ornate prismatic robes of an ancient pharaoh, crowned with a golden pschent that glows faintly in the darkness. “What is it you expected to find?”</p><p>“Are you one of the gods who dwells in this castle?” Virgil asks, approaching the being. “Why is this place so dark and lonely?”</p><p>The regal figure permits an unhappy expression to flicker briefly over its countenance. “The gods you seek have fled their castle on unknown Kadath to dwell in another land, a land so marvelous they have forgotten how to be gods. Will you help me right this wrong?” the figure asks. Before Virgil can reply, it pulls its arm back and drives a razor- sharp blade of onyx through Virgil’s chest. His corpse slides to the polished floor, eyes forever frozen in tragic shock. The figure turns toward you, its shadow shifting into myriad shapes as it stretches across the ground. “No,” its many voices growl. “It is not enough.”</p>",
  "grandDesign4": "<p><b>Grand Design 4:</b> All the while, the black cat stays perched on your shoulder, watching with cold, narrow eyes. It is as if it has read this script many times before, but only now seen the actors play their parts. “I’m sorry, Virgil,” it says. Only it isn’t.</p>",

And yet, when you try to recall any of it, you remember very little. It is all a haze—like distant memories from decades ago. Just the hint of the dream remains. A black castle. A ship sailing through space. A staircase. A black cat. The only thing you remember is a voice in your head. A fundamental truth of the universe that you cannot shake from your memory. It speaks to you, even now, as you tremble under the hospital sheets: “Your dreams are mine!”</p>",
    "resolution1": "<p><b>Resolution 1:</b> The presence taunting your mind retreats into the shadows, and you are left once again with an overwhelming sense of loneliness. The vast halls of the onyx castle are evidence of nothing but despair and sorrow. Whatever gods once inhabited this place left long ago. Coming here was indeed folly. You carry Virgil’s corpse out into the snowy peaks of Kadath and bury him outside the castle. You still do not understand what the being known as Nyarlathotep wanted with him, or with you, but at least now you can leave the Dreamlands behind...if that is truly what you wish to do.</p>",
    "resolution2": "<p><b>Resolution 2:</b> There is nothing remaining of the presence that once taunted your mind. You are left once again with an overwhelming sense of loneliness. The vast halls of the onyx castle are evidence of nothing but despair and sorrow. But at least now they are no longer haunted by the being that lured you here. You understand now what its purpose was all along: to delve into your mind, discern your shape, and awaken alongside you. To become master of both dreams and reality at once. The black cat—whatever it truly was—must have seen this in its visions. You carry Virgil’s corpse out into the snowy peaks of Kadath and bury him outside the castle. With your quest complete, you have no reason to dwell in this place any longer. You can finally leave the Dreamlands behind...if that is truly what you wish to do.</p>",

    "resolution4": "<p><b>Resolution 4:</b> You think about the many journeys you have had in the Dreamlands and the fabulous things you have seen: the mystical forests, the beautiful palaces, the cerulean oceans. Had you ever experienced such wonders in the waking world? Could you really return to such a mundane life after what you have experienced here? Perhaps it would be better to stay. You can escape from this dreaded land of Leng and travel back to safer climes. You can live in the timeless realm of Celephaïs, where pleasures are abundant, and you will never age. Or perhaps live amongst the cats in the pleasant town of Ulthar where your quest began. Or explore the boundaries of the Dreamlands and see all of the marvels that it has to offer. Your mind is made up. You cannot return to the waking world, for you never want to leave.</p>",
    "resolution5": "<p><b>Resolution 5:</b> You recall what the black cat told you about your companions’ journey. Though you have no desire to leave the surface of the Dreamlands behind, there may be a way you can help your friends. You climb back down the northernmost peaks of Leng, returning to the domed ruins where you were confronted by Nyarlathotep’s high priest. There, in the center of the room, is the gaping pit that leads into the untold depths of the Underworld. Your companions are down there, somewhere...right?</p>"
