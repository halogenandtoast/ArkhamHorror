    "body": "<p>Crimson-tinted fog bathes the sky as you reach the gatehouse of Falcon Point. Atop the cliffs above you, the lighthouse beacon pierces through the mist. Considering the state of Innsmouth, you wonder what purpose the signal serves now. You doubt there are any ships out at sea given the inclement weather.</p><p>Somewhere inside is the evidence you found weeks ago. You suspect that Oceiros—the man who captured you and left you in that pit to die—also resides within. “Are you ready?” Agent Harper asks. “We have no real escape route here, should things go south. Be prepared for anything.”</p><p>You nod. It’s too late to turn back now. Steadily, you make your way toward the cliffs. One way or another, this ends today.</p>"
